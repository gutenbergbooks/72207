<p class="ph2">BOMBA THE JUNGLE<br>
BOY AT THE GIANT<br>
CATARACT</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE SUDDEN ATTACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> made his way as silently as a panther
through the jungle.</p>

<p>For that jungle abounded in enemies, as the boy
had had occasion to know. At any moment a boa
constrictor might drop like a flash from a tree
above and seek to enfold him in its crushing coils.
A turn of the trail might bring him face to face
with a crouching jaguar. Or a cooanaradi, deadliest
of all venomous snakes, might launch itself
from the underbrush and inject its poison into his
veins.</p>

<p>There were human foes, too, against whom
Bomba had to be on his guard. With the natives
who dwelt in that part of the jungle he was on
comparatively friendly terms, though he never
mingled with them on a footing of intimacy.</p>

<p>But from time to time the dreaded headhunters
from the faraway region of the Giant Cataract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
invaded this district in search of the hideous trophies
which their name implied wherewith to adorn
their wigwams.</p>

<p>Their coming was a signal for the native inhabitants
to flee, carrying along with them their children
and scanty household belongings. The headhunters
were cruel and ruthless, and death and
destruction followed in their wake.</p>

<p>Bomba had seen signs of them that very morning,
and he had no desire for a closer acquaintance.
On two previous occasions, he and Casson, the
aged naturalist with whom he lived, had been
sought out by these dreaded savages and had
narrowly escaped with their lives. A third time
they might not be so fortunate.</p>

<p>“And as I have only one head, I am exceedingly
anxious to keep it on my shoulders,” the boy had
told Casson.</p>

<p>So it was with extreme caution that Bomba
threaded his way through the jungle, his eyes
darting from right to left, plumbing the recesses
of every thicket, piercing the foliage of every tree.
With him eternal vigilance was the price, not only
of liberty, but of life itself.</p>

<p>There was a sudden rustling in the leaves of a
giant dolado tree. Bomba halted instantly, drew
an arrow from his belt and fitted it to the string
of his bow.</p>

<p>But his tense attitude relaxed as the leaves were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
thrust aside and the grinning, friendly face of a
monkey framed itself in the opening.</p>

<p>“Doto!” exclaimed Bomba, in accents of relief
and pleasure, as he waved his hand to the newcomer.</p>

<p>Welcome was in the tone and gesture, and the
monkey dropped from branch to branch, finally
landing lightly on the ground. Its eyes gleamed
with affection as Bomba caressed its head.</p>

<p>The boy—for he was no more than that, being
fourteen years old at the most—presented a striking
picture as he stood there with a ray of sunlight
falling athwart his face. He was taller than the
average boy of his age and far more muscular and
more sturdily built.</p>

<p>From constant exposure to sun and storm, his
face was as bronzed as that of an Indian, but his
features betrayed the fact that he was of the white
race. His eyes and hair were brown, his nose
strong and aquiline, and his firm jaw denoted
courage and resolution.</p>

<p>He wore the mendiyeh, or native tunic, and
across his breast was slung a puma skin—that of
Geluk, the puma, that he had come across and
slain when it was trying to kill the friendly parrots,
Kiki and Woowoo. His arms and legs were
bare, and showed the powerful muscles rippling
under the brown skin at every movement. On his
feet were home-made sandals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>In his belt he carried a machete, a two-edged
knife fully a foot in length and ground to an
almost razor-like sharpness. A pouch at his waist
held his arrows and a five-chambered revolver, the
only firearm he had ever owned, the gift of two
white men whose camp he had saved from a night
attack by jaguars.</p>

<p>“So Doto is glad to see Bomba back!” said the
boy as he fondled the animal’s furry head. “And
Bomba is glad to meet Doto again. Bomba has
been away for many days and has seen many
things. He has met men whose hearts are black.
He has seen mountains break apart and fire come
from the top. Snakes and jaguars have tried to
kill him.”</p>

<p>The monkey uttered sounds that would have
been unintelligible to many, but that Bomba knew
were meant to express sympathy. The boy had
an almost uncanny power over animals, and had
many friends among the less savage denizens of
the jungle, such as the monkeys and parrots. He
talked to them and they chattered back at him,
and they had arrived at a point where they could
understand each other in simple things. Tone
and gesture helped to interpret the words and
sounds, and each knew intuitively whether the
other were sad or glad and they shared emotions
in common.</p>

<p>“Bomba’s heart is heavy,” the lad went on, “for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
he has not done what he wanted to do. He went
to see Jojasta, the medicine man. He thought the
man could tell him about his father and mother.
But Jojasta was killed before he could tell Bomba
what Bomba wanted to know. He told Bomba
something, but not enough.”</p>

<p>The lad was speaking more to relieve his own
sore heart than anything else, but Doto seemed to
understand, and put his hairy paw consolingly on
the boy’s arm.</p>

<p>“And now before many moons Bomba must go
away again,” the lad resumed, “for Jojasta told
Bomba that he must go to Sobrinini of the Pilati
tribe, beyond the Giant Cataract, and that she
could tell him about his father and mother. It is
a long way off, and there are many dangers in the
way. Bomba may never come back, may never
see Doto again.”</p>

<p>The monkey uttered a wail and snuggled closer
to Bomba as though in fear of immediate parting.
The boy patted the animal’s head affectionately
and roused himself from his musings.</p>

<p>“Bomba must go fast,” he said. “He is on his
way home to Casson. He has been away a long
time, and he does not know whether Casson is
alive or dead. So Bomba must hurry.”</p>

<p>As the lad started on in haste, Doto broke out
into excited chatterings and clung to Bomba’s arm
as though to hold him back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Bomba knew at once that the animal was trying
to warn him of threatening danger, and he stopped
short in his tracks.</p>

<p>“What is it, Doto?” he asked.</p>

<p>There was another outbreak of sounds that
would have been meaningless to anyone else, but
which Bomba had no trouble in interpreting correctly.</p>

<p>His face grew grave as he listened.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said. “The headhunters, the men
with black hearts, are in the jungle. I have seen
their signs this morning. I thought that I had got
past them. But Doto, from the tops of the trees,
can see farther than I can. Where are these men
with the bloody hands?”</p>

<p>The monkey pointed in front of them in the
very direction Bomba was taking.</p>

<p>The boy hushed the monkey’s chattering and
stood silent as a statue, listening.</p>

<p>From his long experience in the jungle he had
become preternaturally sharp of hearing. He
knew all the sounds of the jungle and could interpret
them accurately.</p>

<p>But strain his ears as he might, he could detect
nothing out of the ordinary. There was the usual
hum of insects, the occasional howl of a monkey or
shriek of a parrot. But there was nothing to indicate
that, besides himself, there was any human
being in that part of the jungle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>He glanced at Doto with a look of inquiry, as
though to ask if the animal might not be mistaken.
But Doto held to his arm with such a frenzied
clutch that Bomba decided to trust in the creature’s
instinct or knowledge—or both.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. In spite of his eagerness
to reach Casson, about whose condition he
was in a ferment of anxiety, he must make a long
circuit to avoid the region in which Doto had indicated
that danger lay.</p>

<p>So he changed his course, left the faint trail
that he had been following, and swung out in a
sweeping semicircle, with every nerve at tension
and every sense on the alert. With him went his
friend, Doto.</p>

<p>On the route he was now pursuing there was no
trail, and Bomba had to hack a way through the
underbrush. This involved exhausting work and
made his progress slow. But most of all he
dreaded it for fear that the noise he necessarily
made should attract the attention of lurking foes.</p>

<p>At times, when the brush was very thick, Doto
would climb to the lowest branch of a tree and
swing from one bough to the other of the interlacing
trees, and Bomba, who was almost as agile
as the monkey himself, followed his companion’s
example.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the jungle thinned a little, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
they traversed the forest with redoubled speed in
order to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>An hour had passed when Doto suddenly
grasped the lad’s arm and pulled him to the
ground. At the same moment, an arrow whizzed
over Bomba’s head. A second later another
arrow followed and buried itself in a tree, where
it hung quivering.</p>

<p>Bomba’s enemies were upon him!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>AT GRIPS WITH DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> a flash, Bomba acted.</p>

<p>He knew that if he rose he would be offering
himself as a target. At least two of his foes were
near at hand. There might be more.</p>

<p>Not fifty feet away was a fallen tree, a veritable
monarch of the jungle, that he and Doto had
made their way over with difficulty. Its branches
and foliage spread over a large area.</p>

<p>Turning in that direction, keeping on hands and
knees and motioning Doto to follow, Bomba made
his way through the intervening thickets with as
much speed as possible.</p>

<p>Had his enemies followed at once, Bomba
would probably have been discovered and overtaken.
But they were wary, and from previous
experiences of their fellows knew to what deadly
effect Bomba could shoot. So, from their places
of concealment, they waited for the target once
more to present itself.</p>

<p>And when, a few minutes later, they were reinforced
by some of their mates and rushed forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
in a body to the place where Bomba had
last been seen, their expected prey had vanished.</p>

<p>Bomba had utilized those few precious minutes
to the utmost. Moving noiselessly and yet rapidly,
he had reached the vast mass of branches and
ensconced himself in their furthest depths.</p>

<p>His concealment was aided also by the fact that
the tree had fallen across a hollow, so that there
was a deep hole directly under the trunk. Into this
Bomba burrowed, crouching low so that his whole
body was hidden even should the branches and
foliage be thrust aside by his pursuers.</p>

<p>He had sent Doto off in another direction, as
the monkey could be of no help to him if it came
to a fight, and might by its chattering betray his
hiding place to his enemies.</p>

<p>And now, with his heart beating rapidly but with
his courage at the highest pitch, Bomba waited for
the coming of his enemies.</p>

<p>He knew that he was in desperate straits and
that, if discovered, he would be doomed. But
before the end came he would do his utmost to take
some of his foes with him.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the boy that at this
supreme moment he thought more of Casson than
of himself. He had so often faced death that it
had lost most of its terrors.</p>

<p>But Casson! Poor, sick, half-demented Casson!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
What would become of him if anything
should happen to Bomba, who had so long been
his reliance and defender?</p>

<p>In that confined space the lad’s bow and arrows
were of no use to him. But he had his revolver
fully loaded, and at such short range it could be
trusted to do deadly execution. And as a last
resort, if it came to a hand to hand fight, there
was his machete, in the use of which he was a
master.</p>

<p>Before long he could hear his pursuers beating
the bushes in the vicinity, giving utterance to
grunts of rage as their search continued fruitless.</p>

<p>He held his breath and waited.</p>

<p>Then he heard another sound, faint at first but
gradually becoming more definite, a rustling as
of some soft, long body slithering through the
brush.</p>

<p>At intervals there was a sound like a rattle, as
though the creature had encountered some obstacle
that had aroused its irritation and was taking this
way of showing it.</p>

<p>Bomba knew that sound, and his heart skipped a
beat.</p>

<p>A snake was coming toward him, the deadly
jaracara, the South American rattlesnake, the
slightest puncture of whose fangs meant death!</p>

<p>What should he do? He could not retreat.
If he shot the reptile the noise would bring his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
human enemies surging down upon him. If he
attempted to use his machete, the snake’s stroke
would be quicker than Bomba’s blow, and the
creature’s fangs would be imbedded in his flesh.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were racing through his
mind he saw the loathsome body and the triangular
head of the jaracara come into view not ten feet
away.</p>

<p>At the same moment the reptile caught sight of
Bomba. It stopped short in surprise. Then its
eyes snapped with malignant fury. Like a flash
it threw its body into a coil and upreared its head
to strike.</p>

<p>But in that short moment an inspiration had
come to Bomba. He grasped a long stick and
prodded its coils. Instantly the snake struck at
the stick. Before it could recover, Bomba had
pounced upon it and his sinewy hands had closed
upon its throat.</p>

<p>Then ensued a terrific struggle, with the death
of one or perhaps both of the combatants as the
only possible outcome—a struggle all the more
terrible for Bomba, because it had to be carried
on in silence.</p>

<p>And while he holds that slippery throat with
the clutch of desperation, as the snake twists and
writhes and tries to bite, it may be well, for the
benefit of those who have not read the preceding
volumes of this series, to tell who Bomba was and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
what had been his adventures up to the time at
which this story opens.</p>

<p>From his earliest childhood, as far as his memory
went, Bomba had lived with Cody Casson in
the jungle. The latter was a naturalist, who had
withdrawn from civilization and settled in a little
cabin in the remotest part of the Amazonian
region. He was moody and abstracted, and often
went for days at a time without speaking except in
monosyllables.</p>

<p>But he was kind to Bomba, and a warm attachment
existed between them. He had started
to give the boy the rudiments of an education.
But one day, when Casson fired at an anaconda
that was darting at Bomba, the gun burst and laid
Casson on his back, while the wounded anaconda
retreated. Bomba had dragged his injured companion
to their cabin and nursed him back to
physical health. But Casson’s head had been injured
by the explosion, and from that time on he
was half-demented, though harmless. The lessons
ceased abruptly, and Bomba became the
provider and protector of the little family of two.</p>

<p>Thrown thus early on his own resources, Bomba
had developed into a remarkable physical specimen
of boyhood, daring, strong, and versed in all
the craft of the jungle. He was surrounded by
daily perils, to which a weaker nature would have
succumbed. Serpents and wild beasts sought his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
life. But against them he matched his own
courage and cunning, and had so far survived.</p>

<p>He knew comparatively nothing of the outside
world. The jungle filled his whole horizon. But
he knew that he was different from the natives of
that region. Tugging at his heart was the knowledge
that he was white, and he was possessed with
a great desire to come in contact with his own
people, to learn of their ways and dwell among
them.</p>

<p>He knew that he was out of place where he
was. The call of the blood was strong within
him. He had a great longing to know of his
parentage. He had questioned Casson repeatedly
on this point, and the old man had striven in vain
to tell him. But his memory had failed at the
critical moment, and all that he could do was to
mention the names “Bartow” and “Laura,” which
Bomba concluded must refer to his parents.</p>

<p>How Bomba met two white rubber hunters,
Gillis and Dorn, and won their gratitude by saving
their lives when their camp was attacked at night
by jaguars; how he trapped the cooanaradi when
it pursued him; how he drove off the vultures when
they assailed his friends the monkeys; how the
latter came to his aid when the cabin was besieged
by the headhunters—these adventures are told in
the first book of this series, entitled: “Bomba the
Jungle Boy; or, The Old Naturalist’s Secret.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Although Casson could not himself remember
the facts about Bomba’s parentage, he told him
that he could learn all he wanted to know from
Jojasta, the medicine man of the Moving Mountain.
It was a long journey that Bomba had in
prospect to reach Jojasta, but the urge to go was
so strong that the lad determined to attempt it.
After beating off another attack of the headhunters,
Bomba took Casson down the river and
delivered him to the care of Pipina, an old squaw
for whom he had done many favors, and set out
to find Jojasta.</p>

<p>From the very start his journey was beset with
dangers from man and beast, flood and earthquake.
He was instrumental in delivering from
the power of the savages a Mrs. Parkhurst, whom
he always referred to in his mind as “the woman
with the golden hair.” Later he found her son,
Frank, and in their joint adventures the boys grew
strongly attached to each other, and Frank’s
stories of the wonders of civilization intensified
Bomba’s longings to see those things for himself.</p>

<p>How Bomba was swallowed up in an earthquake
and hurled into a subterranean cavern that
promised to become a living tomb; by what a
marvelous combination of nerve and good fortune
he reached the open air and sunlight; how he
finally found Jojasta after the latter had been
fatally hurt by the fall of his temple; the partial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
but not sufficient information he received from the
dying man regarding his parents; the obstacles he
surmounted and the perils he escaped are told in
the preceding volume of this series, entitled:
“Bomba the Jungle Boy at the Moving Mountain;
or, The Mystery of the Caves of Fire.”</p>

<p>And now to return to Bomba, as he fights his
life-and-death battle with the snake amid the
branches and foliage of the fallen tree, not daring
to make a sound lest he betray his hiding place to
the savages who were hunting for him only a short
distance away.</p>

<p>Beneath the scaly skin of the jaracara there was
tremendous muscular power, and this was made
more available when the reptile secured a purchase
by wrapping its long body about the boy’s leg.</p>

<p>It squirmed and writhed and twisted, seeking
to sink its fangs into the hands that held it. Its
jaws, slavering with poison, were never more than
a few inches from the boy’s flesh. If Bomba’s
hands should slip from that slimy throat ever so
little, his doom would be sealed.</p>

<p>The snake knew this and redoubled its exertions.
But Bomba knew it too, and held on with
desperation, sinking his powerful fingers deeper
and deeper into the reptile’s throat.</p>

<p>If he could only hold on a little longer!</p>

<p>For time was on his side. The snake, deprived
of breath by that choking grasp, must eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
succumb. Its only chance lay in the possibility
of Bomba’s hands slipping or his nerve failing.</p>

<p>But his hands did not slip nor did his nerve fail.</p>

<p>Gradually the struggles of the snake grew
weaker. A glaze began to steal over the horrid
eyes. The grip of its body about the boy’s leg
slowly relaxed. Then at last the reptile straightened
out and its head hung limp.</p>

<p>Bomba still retained his grip for another minute
or two to make assurance doubly sure. Then,
when no doubt remained, he threw the reptile to
the ground and with one stroke of his machete
cut off its head.</p>

<p>Only then did he sink down on the ground,
panting and exhausted. The tax had been a tremendous
one, not only on his muscles but also on
his nerves. He had seldom been brought more
closely face to face with death.</p>

<p>But he had conquered, and a tingle of exultation
ran through his veins. He cast a glance of disgust
at the grinning head of his dead foe, and then
turned his attention to the human enemies without.</p>

<p>The struggle had been carried on in such silence
that it had not attracted their attention. They
were still at some distance, beating the bushes for
their prey and uttering exclamations of disappointment
and chagrin.</p>

<p>It was too much to hope, however, that sooner
or later their attention would not be drawn toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the tree, and Bomba held himself prepared for
that eventuality.</p>

<p>He wiped his knife on the foliage and restored
it to his belt. Then, with his revolver held ready
for action, he crouched low in the hollow and
waited.</p>

<p>He could hear the savages coming nearer and
nearer. The crackling of the bushes and their
guttural conversation became more distinct.</p>

<p>Then the branches of the tree were pushed
aside and a ray of light shot through!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>IN THE NICK OF TIME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> caught a glimpse of half a dozen brawny
forms and brutal faces and dropped at once into
the hollow so that he was wholly concealed.</p>

<p>A pang stabbed his heart as he noted the number
of his enemies. Against so many he could not
hope to conquer, if it came to a fight. He might
bring down one or two, possibly three, but the
others would overcome him.</p>

<p>But his stout heart refused to quail. He had
the advantage of position. He could see them
outlined against the light more readily than they
could discover him in the darkness. He could at
least have the satisfaction of selling his life dearly.</p>

<p>Several of the savages crowded in among the
foliage, pushing the branches and leaves aside so
that light could penetrate.</p>

<p>But the light was dim, though strong enough
to show the outline of the giant trunk. To the
peering eyes of the savages, it seemed to be lying
flat on the ground, and they failed to discern the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
hollow underneath. As far as they could see
there was no one hiding there.</p>

<p>“Not here,” grunted one of them, already weary
with previous effort in searching the bushes.</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart leaped at this indication of giving
up the search. But it sank again when a voice
that had authority in it said:</p>

<p>“Go in farther. Make sure.”</p>

<p>Grumblingly the men obeyed, and Bomba could
hear them coming nearer. He tightened his hold
on the revolver.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a shriek of fright, and one
of the savages jumped a foot into the air. Then
he made a break for the open, shouting:</p>

<p>“Snake! Snake!”</p>

<p>His comrades followed, rushing with frantic,
headlong haste into the clearing.</p>

<p>In a flash, Bomba, the jungle boy, comprehended
what had happened. The intruder had stepped on
the soft, yielding body of the dead serpent and
had jumped to the conclusion that it was alive.
Naturally, he had not waited to investigate, but
had leaped out of the reach of the supposedly
deadly fangs.</p>

<p>Now he stood outside the mass of branches and
was jabbering excitedly as he told of his narrow
escape.</p>

<p>The examination of that particular mass of
branches stopped then and there. The men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
reasonably certain, anyway, that their hoped-for
victim was not there, and they were perfectly content
to leave the snake in undisturbed possession.</p>

<p>Bomba could hear them moving farther and
farther off until at last the sound of their footsteps
and voices died away in the distance.</p>

<p>He could scarcely believe in his good fortune.
He had steeled himself for the conflict that seemed
almost inevitable and from which he had not
expected to emerge alive.</p>

<p>The coming of the snake, which had filled him
with horror, had really proved a blessing. Living,
it had tried to kill him. Dead, it had helped to
save him.</p>

<p>Bomba lay in the hollow perfectly still for
some time, fearing that his enemies might return.
But when an hour had passed without any sound
to alarm him, he ventured cautiously to creep
toward the edge of the pile of branches and look
about.</p>

<p>His keen eyes scanned the jungle in every direction,
but could discern no trace of his enemies.
He had known from the sound of their retreating
footsteps that they were not between him and his
goal. They had gone in the direction that he had
already traversed. That special group, at least,
would now be in the rear of him instead of in front.</p>

<p>This conclusion was confirmed when Doto
dropped down from a tree, where his sharp eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
had noted all that had happened, and rubbed up
against Bomba, chattering his delight.</p>

<p>“They have gone then, Doto?” asked Bomba,
as he slung his bow over his shoulder. “They are
far away?”</p>

<p>The monkey chattered an affirmative and
pointed back of them.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Bomba. “I must go fast now
to reach Casson. You saved Bomba’s life, Doto.
If you had not pulled him down the arrow would
have found him. Doto is good, and Bomba will
not forget.”</p>

<p>A gratified look came into the monkey’s eyes.
He wanted to go along with Bomba, but the latter
did not think it best.</p>

<p>“You stay here, Doto,” he said, as he gently
released his arm from the monkey’s hold. “Bomba
will soon see you again.”</p>

<p>Then, as the affectionate animal seemed a little
crestfallen, the boy added:</p>

<p>“But you can keep watch, and if you see the
men with black hearts coming after Bomba, you
must come and tell him. You can go faster
through the trees than they can through the
jungle.”</p>

<p>Doto seemed to understand, and with a last
pat of his paw shinned up the nearest tree. Bomba
knew that he had left behind him a vigilant and
faithful sentinel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>A glance at the sun told the boy that it was
already afternoon, and that he must hasten if he
were to reach the cabin of Pipina before the
shadows of night closed about him.</p>

<p>So he started off at a rapid pace, employing all
his woodsmanship to avoid obstacles and steer as
straight a course as possible. For a part of the
way there were woodland trails, and then he made
good time. When he could, which was often, he
jumped over the thickets instead of hacking his
way through them, leaping into the air as lightly
as a deer and landing softly on the other side.</p>

<p>Before long he was on familiar ground, and
knew that he was reaching the cabin where he and
Casson had lived for so many years. It had been
burned during the last foray of the headhunters,
and was now uninhabitable. But all that Bomba
had ever known of home was bound up in it.</p>

<p>So a certain melancholy pleasure warmed his
heart as he came out into the clearing and looked
at the part of the smoke-blackened wall that remained
standing. Without being conscious of it,
tears stood in his eyes, and he vowed that he would
rebuild when the headhunters should have removed
their dreaded presence from the jungle.</p>

<p>But he had no time now to indulge in reflections.
A hasty search of the river bank revealed his canoe
in the tree-hung inlet where he had hidden it.</p>

<p>He untied it, sent it with a push into the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of the stream, and began paddling down the river.</p>

<p>It was a long journey, but his powerful arms
sent the canoe whizzing along at a great pace.
The current was with him, and he knew that,
barring accidents, he would reach the hut of
Pipina before dark.</p>

<p>But “accidents,” he had come to learn, were
almost daily occurrences in the jungle, and he did
not abate a jot of his vigilance, his keen eyes keeping
on the lookout everywhere—at the water for
snags or alligators, at either shore for animal or
human enemies, on the trees that overhung the
stream for lurking anacondas.</p>

<p>But though always on the alert, his subconscious
mind was busy with thoughts of his recent journey
and of that which was to come. Would the latter
be more satisfactory than the former? Would
Sobrinini complete the story regarding the mystery
of his parentage that Jojasta had left so incomplete?</p>

<p>Who was Sobrinini? What did she know?
And even if she did know, what would she tell?</p>

<p>Did Casson know her? Would the mention of
her name unlock the door of his memory, that
door that he had tried so desperately but fruitlessly
to open?</p>

<p>But here Bomba’s questioning stopped as the
thought came to him that perhaps there would be
no Casson to tell him anything. The old naturalist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
had been so weak and frail when he had left
him! His hold on life had been so slender! Perhaps
the thread had already snapped.</p>

<p>The thought was an agonizing one to Bomba,
and spurred him to such efforts that the paddle
swept in a wide semicircle as he propelled his
slight craft through the water.</p>

<p>At such a rate of speed did he travel that long
before he had expected he found himself in the
vicinity of his goal.</p>

<p>When he realized that Pipina’s cabin lay beyond
a turn of the river just ahead, Bomba slackened
speed. His habitual caution, bred of long years
in the jungle, asserted itself. He wanted to inspect
the cabin before approaching it.</p>

<p>So, despite his impatience, he rested from his
paddling and let the craft drift with the current
until he rounded the bend.</p>

<p>What he saw then made him dip his paddle
deep and send the canoe in frantic haste toward
the shore.</p>

<p>Before the door of the cabin crouched a huge
puma, preparing for a spring through the doorway!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A TERRIFIC STRUGGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> sight of the crouching brute, Bomba shouted
with all his might.</p>

<p>The beast turned at the shout, fangs bared and
eyes flashing with rage, to meet the newcomer.
Then, with its tail lashing its flanks, it advanced
toward the river bank.</p>

<p>At the same moment a roar came from within
the cabin. And with the roar was blended the
scream of a woman in mortal terror.</p>

<p>As the canoe approached the bank, Bomba fitted
an arrow to his string, drew it to the head and let
it go.</p>

<p>The haste with which he shot and the motion
of the boat disturbed his aim, so that it just grazed
the animal’s head, inflicting a slight flesh wound,
but no mortal injury.</p>

<p>But the pain inflamed the puma’s rage, and as
the canoe had now come within a few feet of the
bank, it prepared to spring.</p>

<p>But just as it was about to launch itself into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the air a second arrow from Bomba’s bow struck
fair to its heart.</p>

<p>With a fearful howl the beast rolled over and
over for a moment, then straightened out and lay
still.</p>

<p>With scarcely a second glance at his dead
adversary, Bomba leaped on the bank and started
to run toward the cabin.</p>

<p>The hut consisted of two rooms, a larger one
in the front and a much smaller one in the rear.
A flimsy door with one rope hinge broken connected
the two.</p>

<p>In the swift glance he sent inside as he reached
the outer doorway, Bomba saw no trace of human
occupants.</p>

<p>What he did see was a puma, larger than the
one he had slain outside, clawing at the inner door
between the two rooms and at times hurling its
huge body against the door. It was a dilapidated
door at the best, and would long since have yielded
to the beast’s attack had it not been for some
barriers placed against it on the other side.</p>

<p>Bomba took in the situation in an instant.
Pipina had seen the beasts approaching and, taking
Casson with her, had retreated to the inner room,
shut the door, and piled against it whatever furniture
she could gather in her frantic haste.</p>

<p>But that it was pitifully inadequate was apparent
at a glance. Already there were breaks in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the door that the puma was trying to enlarge with
its claws so that it could push its body through.
From the other side of the door came the frantic
screams of Pipina, seeing death so near at hand.</p>

<p>In a flash Bomba fitted an arrow to his bow and
let it go. It struck the puma in the shoulder, inflicting
a serious wound but not enough to cripple
it.</p>

<p>With a roar of rage the brute turned to meet its
new enemy. With one spring it was at the door.</p>

<p>The movement had been so lightning fast that
Bomba had no time to shoot again. His only
salvation lay in flight.</p>

<p>Turning, he ran like a deer toward the river
bank, hoping to regain his canoe and push out
into the stream. But even as he did so he felt
that it was hopeless. He was fleet, but the puma
was fleeter. Before he could reach the water it
would be upon him.</p>

<p>Just then he saw out of the corner of his eye a
third puma coming with giant bounds into the
clearing. Then indeed he gave himself up for lost.</p>

<p>He drew his knife, determined to die fighting.
That he was about to die he had no doubt.</p>

<p>But just as he felt the hot breath of his pursuer
on his neck there was a terrific snarling behind him
and the impact of huge bodies.</p>

<p>He glanced behind him and his flight suddenly
halted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>The two great pumas were locked in deadly
combat, clawing and biting, rolling over and over
as each sought to get a grip on the other’s throat.</p>

<p>It was a battle of Titans, and Bomba looked on
with amazement that was transformed into an
expression of delight as he recognized the last
comer.</p>

<p>“Polulu!” he exclaimed. “Good Polulu! He
has come to Bomba’s help.”</p>

<p>He circled about the combatants, seeking to get
in a thrust with his knife that might decide the
battle in favor of the friendly puma. But the
fight was so fast and furious that he was as likely
to wound one as the other.</p>

<p>But Polulu needed no help. His weight and
courage finally told. Before long he succeeded in
getting the throat hold he was seeking, and then
the end was only a matter of a few moments.</p>

<p>But it had been a terrible fight, and after
Polulu had risen from the body of his dead adversary
he was hardly able to move. He staggered
away a few paces, and then lay down panting
and exhausted.</p>

<p>Bomba let him rest awhile, and then went up
to him and caressed the great, shaggy head.</p>

<p>“Polulu is a good friend,” he said gratefully.
“It is not the first time he has saved Bomba’s life.
There is no one in the jungle as big and strong
as Polulu.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The puma tried to purr, and licked the hand
that fondled him.</p>

<p>Their strange friendship was of long standing.
It dated from the time when Bomba had come
across the puma trapped by a tree in the jungle,
that had fallen upon the animal and broken its
leg. The boy of the jungle had been stirred
to pity at the creature’s distress. He had released
him from the weight that held him, bound
up the broken leg, and brought him food and
drink.</p>

<p>By the time Polulu, as Bomba named the puma,
had fully recovered, a strong attachment had
grown up between the oddly assorted pair. Their
paths often crossed in the forest, and more than
once the great beast had saved Bomba from serious
danger. Now, once more, he had come to the
rescue when the lad was at the last extremity.</p>

<p>Leaving the animal to lick its wounds, Bomba
hastened to the hut. Its inmates had no inkling
of what had happened except that for some mysterious
reason the attacks upon the door had
ceased. The screams of the woman had given
place to moaning.</p>

<p>“Pipina! Casson!” shouted Bomba. “It is
Bomba calling. The pumas are dead. Open the
door.”</p>

<p>Again there came a scream, but this time it was
one of delight. There was a hurried removal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the barriers on the other side of the door, and then
the old squaw came rushing out and threw her
arms about Bomba’s neck, crying and laughing in
the same breath.</p>

<p>Behind her came Cody Casson, his steps slow
and uncertain, looking so frail that it seemed as
though a zephyr would have blown him away, but
with an affectionate welcome in his faded eyes.</p>

<p>But he was still alive, and at that moment
nothing else mattered. Dear Casson! Good old
Casson! There were tears in Bomba’s eyes as he
rushed forward and folded the old man in his
embrace.</p>

<p>The two were roused by a shriek from Pipina,
who had gone to the doorway and now came rushing
back in terror.</p>

<p>“There is another puma there!” she cried. “He
is bigger that the others! Quick! Let us get
behind the door again.”</p>

<p>Bomba spoke to her soothingly and with a
smile.</p>

<p>“He is not like the others,” he said. “He is
Bomba’s friend. I killed one puma but he killed
the other. I will bring him here, and you will see.”</p>

<p>But Pipina, despite Bomba’s assurances, had no
desire for an introduction to the giant puma, and
shook her head decidedly, the while she muttered
prayers to her gods.</p>

<p>So Bomba had to be content with bringing out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
haunch of meat and sitting beside Polulu and talking
to him, while the latter munched away contentedly.
Then the great beast rose, stretched
himself, rubbed his head against Bomba’s hand,
and departed again for his haunts in the jungle.</p>

<p>They had a great feast that night, for Pipina
displayed all her skill in making a fitting celebration
of the wanderer’s return.</p>

<p>Bomba was almost famished, and ate greedily
while Pipina beamed with smiles at his tribute to
her cooking. The lad was glad to see also that
Casson had a better appetite than he had had
when Bomba had left him. It was evident that
Pipina had taken good care of him.</p>

<p>But though the old naturalist had improved
physically, there was no change for the better in
his mental condition. Bomba studied him during
the meal and grieved to see that his mind was still
weak and wandering. Would that closed door in
his mind never open?</p>

<p>When the meal was finished and Pipina was busy
with clearing away the food that was left and performing
her simple household tasks, Bomba sat
down beside Casson and told the story of his
journey.</p>

<p>Casson listened, holding Bomba’s brown hand
affectionately in his weak, worn one, happy beyond
words to have the boy back again with him.
But it was with difficulty that the old man kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the thread of the story. At times he would interpose
vague, irrelevant questions that showed how
hard it was for him to understand.</p>

<p>“I saw Jojasta,” said Bomba, “but it was too
late. He was dying. A pillar of the temple fell
on him. And then the earth opened and swallowed
him.”</p>

<p>“Jojasta? Jojasta?” repeated Casson, in a
puzzled way. “Oh, yes, he was the medicine man
of the Moving Mountain. But why did you want
to see Jojasta?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember?” asked Bomba. “You
told me that if I saw him he could tell me about
my father and mother.”</p>

<p>“Father and mother,” murmured Casson, and
lapsed into silence, during which he seemed to be
cudgeling his poor, disordered brain to make it
yield up its secrets.</p>

<p>“He thought I was Bartow when he saw me,”
went on Bomba.</p>

<p>At the name the old man brightened.</p>

<p>“Bartow!” he exclaimed. “I have heard that
name.”</p>

<p>“Is he my father?” asked Bomba eagerly.</p>

<p>Casson tried desperately to remember.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” he said at last piteously.</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart sank, but he tried again.</p>

<p>“I asked him about Laura, too,” he went on,
watching Casson narrowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Laura, dear sweet Laura,” murmured the old
man with emotion, tears coming to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Who is she? Where is she? Oh, tell me,
Casson!” Bomba begged, with all his heart in his
voice.</p>

<p>“She is—she is—oh, why is it that I cannot remember?”
exclaimed Casson in desperation.</p>

<p>“Jojasta knew. Jojasta could have told you,”
the old man went on after a pause. “But you say
that he is dead.”</p>

<p>“He is dead,” replied Bomba. “But before he
died he told me that Sobrinini——”</p>

<p>Then came a startling interruption.</p>

<small>TERRIBLE JAWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the mention of Sobrinini’s name Cody Casson
sprang to his feet, his weakness temporarily
banished, and began to dance around the room,
singing in a cracked, treble voice “la, la, la!” over
and over again. Not until he was exhausted did
he cease his gyrations and sink quivering into his
chair.</p>

<p>Bomba watched the sudden transformation
with consternation and alarm. What did this
strange outbreak mean?</p>

<p>But he forebore to question until Casson ceased
trembling and became once more like his customary
self. Then the boy leaned toward the old man
and said gently:</p>

<p>“I was talking about Sobrinini.” Again the old
man started, but did not rise. Bomba went on:</p>

<p>“Jojasta told me to go to Sobrinini, she of the
Pilati tribe beyond the Giant Cataract, to find out
about my father and mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nini ought to know,” muttered Casson.
“She ought to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Who is Sobrinini and why should she know?”
asked Bomba.</p>

<p>But Casson did not answer. He sat, muttering
incoherently, and seemed so tired from his recent
excitement that Bomba was afraid to press the
matter further.</p>

<p>So he tried to calm the old man’s agitation and
a little while later assisted him into his hammock
where he almost immediately fell asleep.</p>

<p>Bomba himself got into his own hammock
and tried to sleep. But although he was dead
tired, he found himself for a long time unable to
close his eyes.</p>

<p>He tossed restlessly about, his mind in a tumult
of unanswered questions. Why was it that Casson
had betrayed such intense excitement at the mention
of Sobrinini’s name? Why had he referred
to her as Nini? That sounded to Bomba like
a pet name, implying long acquaintance and familiarity.
Why did he indulge in that wild fantastic
dance and singing?</p>

<p>One thing was reasonably certain. It was hopeless
to count much on Casson. The disjointed
words that his questioning had brought from the
old man could not be pieced together so as to give
him any reliable information.</p>

<p>So he must go to Sobrinini, must face all the
dangers that would inevitably await him in that
long journey to the Giant Cataract. The thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of abandoning his quest did not even occur to him.
The urge to find out about his parentage was, if
possible, stronger than it had been before. No
difficulties could daunt or deter him.</p>

<p>With his determination firmly fixed in his mind,
he fell at last into an uneasy slumber.</p>

<p>He found plenty of work awaiting him when
he woke in the morning. In the first place, he
had to replace the door that had been so nearly
shattered by the puma, so that Casson and Pipina
could have better protection, if exposed to similar
dangers in the future.</p>

<p>He spent much time and labor on this, and when
a stout door was at last completed, together with
a heavy bar that could be dropped into place, he
felt much easier in his mind.</p>

<p>Then there was the problem of provisioning the
cabin during his coming absence. Though Casson
and Pipina had had plenty while he was gone, their
stock was now greatly depleted and needed replenishing.
So he planned to spend several days
in the jungle in order to bring them home plenty
of meat. This would be cured by Pipina and
would keep indefinitely.</p>

<p>It was bright and early one morning that he
bade Casson and the woman farewell and set out
for his hunting trip in the jungle.</p>

<p>So far as he could learn, the headhunters had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
left that district. He hoped they would stay away
a long time, preferably forever.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before Kiki and Woowoo,
the friendly parrots, fluttered from the trees and
dropped one on each shoulder. A little later
Doto joined him together with other monkeys,
so that he was soon the center of a group of birds
and animals, all competing for a word or a pat of
the hand.</p>

<p>He talked to them, and they chattered back.
Then he took out his harmonica and played for
them, to their great delight. So much did the
lonely boy enjoy converse with those who loved
him that it was with reluctance he finally sent them
away, so that he could go on with his hunting.</p>

<p>Two hours passed without anything coming in
range of his weapons save small creatures that he
disdained to notice. He was after larger game,
preferably a tapir, a creature as large as a calf,
whose meat was succulent and nourishing. A
single one of these would furnish meat enough for
a month.</p>

<p>So he turned his steps toward a large river
where he knew these animals were likely to be
found.</p>

<p>For a long time he had no luck. The sun
reached its zenith and dropped down toward the
western sky. There were plenty of tracks, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
was mid-afternoon before he caught a glimpse of
what he sought.</p>

<p>Then, coming out from a fringe of trees not
far from the river’s edge, he saw a large tapir
browsing on the bank.</p>

<p>It offered an easy target, and Bomba fitted an
arrow to his bow. But unfortunately the wind was
blowing toward the tapir and carried Bomba’s
scent with it.</p>

<p>The animal looked up, saw Bomba, and without
an instant’s hesitation plunged into the river.</p>

<p>Ordinarily that would have ended Bomba’s
chances, for the tapir can swim for a long distance
under water. His game, therefore, could easily
have got beyond bowshot before it would have
been compelled to come to the surface for air.</p>

<p>The boy gave an exclamation of vexation, which
was checked, however, as his eyes, ranging up and
down the river bank, caught sight of a canoe
drawn up among some sedge grass near the shore.
No doubt it belonged to a native who had left it
there while he made a trip into the jungle.</p>

<p>Bomba ran to it, untied it, seized the paddle,
and pushed out into the stream, following as nearly
as he could guess the direction that the tapir had
taken.</p>

<p>But a stern chase is a long chase, as Bomba soon
found. When the tapir did come to the surface,
it was a long way from where Bomba imagined it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
would be, and before he had come within range
of it the beast had gone under again.</p>

<p>But Bomba’s second guess proved a better one,
and the next time the tapir came to the surface
the boy was within ten feet of it.</p>

<p>Bomba dropped his paddle and seized his
weapon. The bow twanged.</p>

<p>The arrow penetrated to the heart of the
animal, and it died almost without a struggle.</p>

<p>Seizing a rope that lay in the bottom of the
canoe, Bomba made a noose and threw it around
the head and shoulders of the tapir, securing it
before it could sink. Then he tied the other end
of the rope to the canoe, and set out for the shore,
towing his quarry behind him.</p>

<p>It was an arduous task, for the tapir weighed
several hundred pounds, and Bomba made slow
progress through the water. But his heart was
exultant, for he had bagged his game. His day
had not been fruitless.</p>

<p>His progress was checked suddenly, so suddenly
that he was thrown on his back on the bottom
of the canoe.</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet and looked back,
thinking that the body of the tapir might have
caught on a snag. At what he saw his heart almost
stopped beating.</p>

<p>It was no snag that had checked the progress of
the canoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>A monster alligator, the cayman of the Amazon
region, was tugging at the tapir, from which it
had already torn a piece of the flank.</p>

<p>Then, as Bomba looked, the water was broken
in several places by the horrid snouts and hideous
jaws of other caymen, that had smelled the blood
of the tapir and were hastening to have their share
of the feast.</p>

<p>Bomba’s first feeling was that of chagrin at
losing his prey. But this gave way at once to an
overpowering sense of his own danger.</p>

<p>Those great jaws tearing at the tapir were sure
to upset the canoe. He must cut the rope.</p>

<p>He drew his machete, sprang to the stern, and
commenced to hack madly at the rope. Before
he could cut through a single strand, there was a
terrific jerk, the canoe turned over, and Bomba
was thrown into the river.</p>

<p>By this time the river was swarming with
alligators!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>PURSUED BY AN ALLIGATOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> was hurled headlong into the green
depths of the river. This in itself would not have
bothered him. He could swim like a fish and was
almost as much at home in the water as on land.</p>

<p>But a thrill of terror passed through him as he
realized that not far away was a group of monsters
that could swim faster than he could, and whose
terrible jaws, once clamped on him, could bite him
in half.</p>

<p>His mind worked with lightning swiftness. He
must remain under water as long as possible. His
instinct for direction told him where the land lay.</p>

<p>So instead of permitting himself to shoot up
to the surface, he remained under and struck out
toward the shore.</p>

<p>For more than a minute he shot ahead at a rapid
pace. And only when it seemed as though his
lungs would burst did he at last rise to the surface.</p>

<p>He shook the water from his eyes and looked
behind him. He could see at least half a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
caymen tearing at the body of the tapir and others
swimming about greedy for their share.</p>

<p>His only hope lay in the possibility that the
brutes would be so busy fighting each other for a
portion of the spoils that they would not notice
him at the distance that he had already attained.</p>

<p>But his chase for the tapir had carried him far
out into the stream and the shore seemed still a
terrible distance away.</p>

<p>He summoned up all his resolution and struck
out for land, keeping himself as low in the water
as possible and moving with scarcely a ripple.</p>

<p>For a time it looked as though his hope might
be realized. Twice he looked behind him, and
each time the brutes still seemed to be fighting
about the body of the tapir.</p>

<p>But the third time he looked back he saw something
that filled him with consternation.</p>

<p>A huge alligator had detached itself from the
group and was making toward him at full speed.
He could see the long, scaly body, the fiery, red
eyes and the hideous jaws with their rows of
glistening teeth.</p>

<p>Bomba turned and swam for his life.</p>

<p>As the lad swam he measured the distance to the
shore. He knew that the alligator was coming
at a faster pace than his own, but he hoped that
the start he had gained might yet enable him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
reach the shore before those terrible jaws should
close on him.</p>

<p>It was a close calculation, but he decided that he
had a chance. He put redoubled power into his
strokes and swam as he had never swum before.</p>

<p>But his heart sank as he noted how steep the
bank was at the nearest point. Had the shore
been shelving, he might have been able to find a
footing when the water grew shallower and rush
up on land before the cayman could reach him.</p>

<p>But the bank was three or four feet high and
ran straight up and down. He would have to
reach up, grasp the edge and pull himself up.
And he realized only too well that before he
could do this the alligator might have caught him.</p>

<p>In his heart Bomba felt that he was doomed.</p>

<p>But his indomitable spirit refused to give up.
He called to his aid all his reserves of force and
swam on. As a last resort he had his knife. He
could stab with it, perhaps hold off for a moment
the vicious rushes of his foe. But as against a
knife, of course the alligator would conquer in the
end.</p>

<p>One last glance Bomba cast behind. The cayman
had made up much of the distance between
them and was now fearfully close. A minute more
perhaps and then——</p>

<p>Bomba cast one farewell look at the sky and
felt for his knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>But as he looked upward, something brushed
across his face. It was the branch of a tree that
hung far out over the water.</p>

<p>A ray of hope cut through the blackness of
the boy’s despair. With the quickness of a cat,
he grasped the branch and swung himself up on it
out of the water. Even as he did so, he heard
beneath him the snap of the alligator’s jaws.</p>

<p>But those awful jaws missed the boy by a hair’s
breadth. The speed at which the brute was going
carried it several yards farther before it could
turn. And by that time, spurred on by dreadful
necessity, Bomba had climbed farther up on the
heavy bough and was out of reach.</p>

<p>The rage of the baffled man-eater was fearful to
witness. It churned the water into foam and
emitted frightful bellowings as it leaped half out
of the water, trying to reach the prey of which it
had been cheated. It gnashed its teeth and its
red eyes gleamed with fury.</p>

<p>For a full half hour Bomba lay extended on
the branch, feeling with unspeakable relief and
delight the strength come back into his muscles
and vitality creep into his exhausted frame.</p>

<p>The alligator still kept up its watch, and Bomba
wondered why. Did it not know that its quarry
had escaped? Then he realized that the brute
was not so stupid after all.</p>

<p>For the alligator is a land as well as a water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
animal, and though its prey had baffled it for a
while, it knew that the boy, soon or late, would
have to descend the tree. And when Bomba
should slide down the trunk to the ground, his
enemy meant to clamber up the bank and be waiting
at the foot of the tree to receive him.</p>

<p>Luckily Bomba’s bow was still slung over his
shoulder and his arrows were at his belt. His
immersion had been so sudden that he had not
had time to discard them. They had hindered
him in his swimming, but now he blessed the fact
that they were with him.</p>

<p>His position was a difficult one to shoot from,
for he would have to use both hands for his bow
and depend on his sense of equilibrium to keep
him secure on the branch. If he should lose his
balance, he would topple into the water, and he
shuddered to think what would happen after that.</p>

<p>He solved his problem in part by wrapping
both legs closely around the bough. Then he
fitted an arrow to his string and took careful aim.</p>

<p>He knew that about the only vulnerable part
of the alligator was the eye. An arrow striking
anywhere else would simply rebound from the
tough hide without inflicting any material damage.</p>

<p>It was some time before Bomba could get a
good view of his target. The cayman kept swimming
about with its head half submerged in the
turbid water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>But at last the alligator lifted its head and
glared at the boy. At the same instant Bomba
shot.</p>

<p>The arrow went straight to its mark, pierced
the creature’s eye and penetrated to the brain.</p>

<p>There was an awful bellow and a tremendous
thrashing about for a few moments. Then the
alligator slowly sank below the surface of the
river.</p>

<p>Bomba waited for some time, but the body did
not reappear. The arrow had done its work
well.</p>

<p>Once fully convinced of this, the boy made his
way to the trunk of the tree and slid down it to the
ground.</p>

<p>It was good to feel the earth again beneath his
feet. His heart swelled with gratitude. True, he
had been cheated. The alligators had robbed him
of his tapir. But they had not robbed him of his
life, and compared with that fact everything else
seemed insignificant.</p>

<p>The sun was near its setting now, and his hunting
would have to be deferred to the next day.
Soon the four-footed hunters of the jungle would
themselves be abroad, and it behooved Bomba to
make himself safe for the night.</p>

<p>Ordinarily he would have collected brush and
made a fire, trusting to the flames to keep wild
beasts at bay. But now, owing to the possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
presence of the dreaded headhunters in the jungle,
he dared do nothing that would betray his presence
to the marauders. He had not detected any signs
of them so far, but a sort of sixth sense told him
that they had not yet returned to their homes
above the Giant Cataract.</p>

<p>He gathered some jaboty eggs which he ate
raw, and which, with some cured meat he had
brought with him from the cabin of Pipina, made
a simple but satisfying meal.</p>

<p>Then he cast about for some place in which he
could pass the night.</p>

<p>He found it in the center of a dense thorn
thicket, into which he penetrated slowly and with
great care, pushing the thorny stalks aside so that
they would not wound his flesh. Once in the
center, he beat down enough of the brush to serve
him as a bed, and covered it with bunches of soft
moss that he had gathered near the river’s edge.</p>

<p>Here he was safe. Even if his scent betrayed
him, no wild beast was likely to venture through
the thorns. And if, perchance, some prowling
brute, more daring or hungry than the rest, should
try it, the noise made would awaken the boy at
once and he could trust to his weapons for the
rest.</p>

<p>As he lay there, waiting for sleep to come, his
thoughts were tinctured somewhat with bitterness.
Why should his life be in constant peril? Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
should he be doomed to be hunted by beast and
reptile?</p>

<p>It was not as though he were a native of the
jungle. Then he might have accepted his lot as
the decree of fate and borne whatever came to
him with stolidity, if not with resignation.</p>

<p>But his real place was not there. He was
white. He was heir to all the instincts, traditions
and ambitions of his race. He belonged elsewhere.
Then why was he here? Why were his
aspirations and longings doomed to be thwarted?
What had he done to deserve such a fate?</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to Frank Parkhurst. What
a difference there was between their lots! No
doubt by this time Frank had reached one of the
cities he had talked about and whose wonders had
so deeply stirred the jungle boy. To-night Frank
would be sleeping safely in a soft bed. He would
have abundance of good food. He would be
laughing and talking with others of his kind. And
his mother, the woman with the golden hair,
would print a good-night kiss upon his lips.</p>

<p>But Bomba had no mother near him to kiss him
good-night. He had no friends to talk to, to
clap on the shoulder in jovial fashion, as Gillis had
done to Dorn. Monkeys and parrots were his
only intimates, except poor demented Casson and
the squaw, Pipina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>As to laughter—when had Bomba last laughed?
He could not remember.</p>

<p>In this melancholy mood he at last fell asleep.</p>

<p>But his depression vanished when he awoke the
next morning. His sleep had been undisturbed.
Weariness had departed. The current of his
blood ran swiftly through his young veins. The
skies were azure. It was good to be alive.</p>

<p>And his optimism was increased by the good
fortune that for the next two days attended his
hunting. Tapirs, deer, agouti and other game
fell before his arrows, until he had accumulated
enough to supply the cabin for weeks to come.</p>

<p>A good deal of his time was consumed in skinning
the animals. He could not carry them home
bodily, as he had no means of conveyance except
his sturdy shoulders. So he cut off the choicest
parts, wrapped them in great leaves tied with bush
cord, and on the third day after he had left the
cabin set out on his return.</p>

<p>All this time he had kept a sharp lookout for the
headhunters. But during the whole of the hunting
trip he had come across no signs of them.</p>

<p>He would have felt easier in his mind, however,
if he had occasionally met some of the friendly
natives that ordinarily dwelt in that region. They,
too, were conspicuous by their absence. If the
headhunters had really gone, why had not the natives
returned to their usual haunts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>The answer was not far to seek. Those
dreaded invaders were probably still lurking somewhere
in the district, and if Bomba had not crossed
their trail, it was simply a bit of good fortune.</p>

<p>A sense of impending calamity grew upon him
as he neared his destination. The burden on his
shoulders was heavy, but it was matched by the
burden on his heart.</p>

<p>He tried to throw off his depression, assuring
himself that it was due to weariness. Soon he
would reach the cabin, be once again with Casson
and Pipina, and all would be well. So he communed
with himself, though not with much conviction.</p>

<p>The journey back to Pipina’s hut was made in
rapid time, the jungle boy being spurred on by
his anxiety.</p>

<p>He turned the bend of the stream from which
he could see the hut, and an exclamation of relief
escaped him as he saw that it was still standing.
He had half-feared that he would find it burned or
demolished.</p>

<p>But it was there, and everything about it seemed
placid and serene. No puma this time ranged
before the door. It seemed an abode of peace.</p>

<p>“Bomba was a fool,” he told himself, as he
hurried forward.</p>

<p>He gave the loud halloo with which he was
accustomed to announce his coming. Usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
this brought either Casson or Pipina to the door
at once.</p>

<p>This time his call evoked no answer. No figure
appeared at the doorway, nor could he hear any
stirring within.</p>

<p>He called again, this time in louder tones. But
again there came no answer.</p>

<p>His uneasiness returning at this unusual circumstance,
he hastily ran up to the hut.</p>

<p>The door stood open and a hurried glance into
the outer room showed that it was empty.</p>

<p>He rushed in and examined the farther room.
No one was there.</p>

<p>“Casson!” he called in a frenzy of anxiety.
“Casson! Pipina! Where are you?”</p>

<p>His only answer was the echo of his voice.</p>

<p>Casson was gone! Pipina was gone!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>CARRIED INTO CAPTIVITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Bomba stood stupefied with
dread. Then he ran out into the open.</p>

<p>He beat the bushes about the hut. He dashed
down to the edge of the ygapo, his quick eye
scanning the expanse for some sign of the passing
of Casson and Pipina.</p>

<p>Nothing anywhere. No footprints, no trampling
of the bushes, no clue to guide him in a search
for the missing ones.</p>

<p>To all appearances no one had trodden that
deserted spot since Bomba had returned from his
journey to the Moving Mountain.</p>

<p>Yet Casson was gone. Pipina was gone.</p>

<p>Bomba retraced his steps to the hut, his mind
in a ferment of bewilderment and grief.</p>

<p>Indians! Only Indians could traverse the jungle
with the silence and stealth of ghosts, leaving
no trace behind.</p>

<p>“Nascanora!” The word hissed between the
boy’s clenched teeth. “This is your work! If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
you have killed Casson, Bomba will not rest until
he has found your heart with an arrow, a bullet,
or a knife!”</p>

<p>The boy reëntered the empty hut with a sharp
pain stabbing at his heart. He would search the
cabin more minutely now for some sign, some clue,
to the whereabouts of the absent ones. And if he
could not find it there, he would call into play all
his skill in woodcraft to find and follow their trail.
For trail there must be somewhere. They could
not have vanished into thin air.</p>

<p>Inch by inch, he scrutinized the walls, the floor,
even every crevice of the crude and meagre furniture,
thinking he might find some message from
Casson. It was almost a forlorn hope, but it was
all that he had at the moment.</p>

<p>He had nearly abandoned even this hope, however,
when he discovered a faint scrawl on the
wall in the darkest corner of the hut. He bent
closer, and his brows drew together in a scowl as
he tried to decipher the writing.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a hoarse cry of rage escaped
him. His eyes blazed in the shadowy hut like
those of an angry puma.</p>

<p>For this was what he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Nascanora is taking away Casson, Pipina,
Hondura to camp near Giant Cataract. Come.
Help.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>So the headhunters had achieved their end at
last! They had captured the helpless old man
whom their superstition had led them to regard as
a Man of Evil, a magician whose spells had
brought blight on their crops and sickness to their
people. Poor old Casson, whose one desire was
to help rather than hurt!</p>

<p>They would torture him. They would make
him a sacrifice to their gods. And when flesh and
blood could no longer stand their torments, they
would kill him and place his head on the wigwam
of their chief.</p>

<p>Bomba’s rage was terrific, and it would have
fared ill with the savage chief if at that moment
he had come within reach of the boy’s knife.</p>

<p>The boy read the scrawl again. So they had
taken Hondura too, the friendly chief of the
Araos tribe, the father of the pretty little girl,
Pirah, who had once saved Bomba’s life!</p>

<p>Why had Nascanora made Hondura captive
with Casson and the squaw? Was it because
Hondura and his tribe had been on friendly terms
with Bomba and the old naturalist? Or did Nascanora
think that the Araos tribe was becoming
too powerful, and had he hoped by depriving them
of their chief to render his people helpless and
throw confusion and panic into their hearts?</p>

<p>But that problem could be left till later for
solution. The pressing thing was to plan for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
rescue of the captives before they were so far
away that their recovery would be impossible.</p>

<p>When his first fury had exhausted itself, Bomba
left the writing on the wall and sat down on the
threshold of the hut, the better to think out a
course of action.</p>

<p>“Near the Giant Cataract” said that rude scrawl
penciled by poor Casson, when the attention of his
captors was momentarily diverted. Bomba had no
clear idea as to how far away that was or what
direction would have to be followed to reach it.
But from what he had gathered from the natives
from time to time, the place was at a great distance,
and he knew that a long and arduous journey
lay before him.</p>

<p>That is, if he had to go that far in order to
catch up with the raiding party. There was
nothing in the hut on which he could base any
judgment as to the time the capture had taken
place.</p>

<p>It might have occurred the very day that he had
left on his hunting trip. In that case, they would
have had a three days’ start of him. Or again
it might have happened yesterday. In that event,
his task of overtaking them would be that much
easier.</p>

<p>No matter how much they wanted to hurry, no
large party could proceed very fast, encumbered
as they were with prisoners and probably laden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
with spoils. Bomba could cover as much ground
in one day as they could in two or possibly in three.
So he had little doubt of his ability to overtake
them before they could get very far.</p>

<p>What he would do if he should come up with
them, he did not pause to consider. No plan
formed now would be of any service. He must
be guided by circumstances as they developed.
But he had enough confidence in his own quick
wit to believe that he would be able to shape such
circumstances to meet his ends.</p>

<p>But time pressed, and he could spend no more
time in reflection. He rose to his feet and secured
some cured meat from Pipina’s stores to feed him
on the way. He would have no time to spend in
hunting food when there were human enemies
requiring his attention.</p>

<p>He tested his bow, put a new string on it, and
replenished his store of arrows. His revolver and
machete were already at his belt. He took one
more look about the cabin to make sure he had
overlooked nothing and plunged into the jungle.</p>

<p>Like a hound when trying to pick up a trail,
he described a long circle, scanning the ground
narrowly for every sign that might indicate the
direction in which the party had gone.</p>

<p>For a long time his search was unsuccessful.
At last his eyes brightened, for they rested on a
little strip of cloth fluttering on a thorn bush. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
examined it carefully and recognized it as a strip
torn from a loose dress such as the Indian women
wear. Probably it was torn from Pipina’s garment.</p>

<p>This was something, but not enough. He must
find a second strip, if possible, and the line formed
by the two would give him the direction in which
the party were traveling.</p>

<p>Before long his eager search was rewarded.
Now he could shape his course, and he hurried
forward with redoubled speed.</p>

<p>The bits of cloth also told the jungle boy another
story. The fact that they had been torn off
at all showed that the savages had been hurrying
their captives along at great speed, and so roughly
that they took no care to avoid the thorn bushes
that tore the clothes and probably the skin.</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart burned within him as he pictured
poor, weak Casson driven along, perhaps flogged
to make him hasten. How long could he endure
such treatment in his feeble condition? Perhaps
even now he had succumbed to the hardships of
the journey! Bomba gritted his teeth and his eyes
flamed with fury.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when his jungle instinct
warned him of danger in the immediate vicinity.
Motions as vague as shadows, faint rustlings that
could not have been detected by an untrained ear,
told him that something or someone was trailing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
him, keeping step with him, moving as swiftly and
silently as he. From being the hunter, he had
become the hunted.</p>

<p>When Bomba paused the slight rustlings
stopped. When he moved on they were resumed.</p>

<p>Still he continued on his way. Whether his
pursuer were beast or human he could not tell.
But the jungle lad knew that, whether beast or
human, the surest way to provoke attack was to
betray a knowledge of his danger.</p>

<p>To keep on would be at least to delay attack
and perhaps derange the plans of his pursuer.
But when the attack at last came—if it should
come—he would be ready.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became conscious that he was encircled.
The faint sound, which had been behind
him, was echoed now on the right and the left
and in the front. His enemies, whoever they were,
were closing in upon him.</p>

<p>There was nothing that his eyes could tell him.
Not a leaf stirred nor was there any movement in
the brush. There was only that ghostly rustling
that to Bomba’s sensitive ears was as plainly perceptible
as the rumbling of distant thunder.</p>

<p>Then something shaped itself, vague and dim
behind a thicket. Like a beast at bay, Bomba
crouched, pulled his bow from his shoulder and
plucked an arrow from his pouch.</p>

<p>Before he could fit the arrow to the string a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
hideous chorus of shouts rent the air, and like
magic the jungle was filled with men, men with
the ferocious faces of demons, who rushed upon
him, shouting and brandishing their sharp, murderous
knives above their heads.</p>

<p>Bomba had no time to turn and flee. He
dropped his bow, whipped out his machete and
backed toward a tree, only to feel himself seized
from behind and borne helpless to the ground.</p>

<p>A score of natives bent above him, their faces
menacing, their knives pointed at his throat.</p>

<p>“Hondura?” grunted one of them. “Where is
he?”</p>

<p>A light dawned upon Bomba. These were
braves of the Araos tribe seeking their leader.
They blamed him, Bomba, for the disappearance
of their chief—Bomba, who at that very moment
was on his way to rescue that chief from captivity.</p>

<p>“Let me up and I will tell you,” he said, refusing
to quail before the fierce eyes directed upon
him.</p>

<p>They hesitated, evidently suspicious of some
trick. But finally the leader, a strapping native
named Lodo, whom Bomba remembered having
seen on his recent visit to their village, ordered
that a close ring be formed about the lad. Then
he ordered him to stand up.</p>

<p>Bomba did so, and Lodo advanced toward him,
knife in hand, his gaze lowering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Where is Hondura, our chief?” he demanded.
“You hide him.”</p>

<p>“The bad chief, Nascanora, take good chief,
Hondura, prisoner,” Bomba replied, his brown
eyes holding the little, shifting ones of Lodo with
great earnestness. “He take, too, my friend Casson
and Pipina, the squaw. Come with me to the
hut, and I will show you the writing on the wall.”</p>

<p>It was plain that the Indians considered this
a subterfuge or a trap, and there was considerable
parleying before Lodo finally announced that they
would take him to the hut.</p>

<p>“But you fool us, Bomba,” threatened Lodo
with a suggestive twist of his knife, “and I cut
out your heart—so!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE MAN WITH THE SPLIT NOSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> raged within himself at this enforced
delay in his journey. But resistance against such
odds would be nothing less than suicide.</p>

<p>And apprehension was in his heart as he moved
along with his captors. He was by no means sure
that he would be able to prove to the natives that
he spoke the truth concerning their chief.</p>

<p>After all, the only proof he had was that writing
on the wall, and if they thought that he was
trying to deceive them they might regard the
writing as part of his plan. There was no likelihood
that any of them would be able to decipher
it for themselves.</p>

<p>So it was with no great confidence as to the
ultimate outcome that he made his way back to
the cabin, surrounded by the lowering bucks of the
Araos tribe and feeling the suspicious gaze of
Lodo boring into his back.</p>

<p>They traveled swiftly, as the way was familiar,
and it was not long before they reached the deserted
hut. Bomba led them into it and pointed
out the faint scrawl on the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Lodo could make nothing of it, and looked
from the writing back to Bomba with a fierce
scowl and a tightened grasp upon his knife.</p>

<p>“You read,” he said, and the cruel point of the
knife pricked Bomba’s bare shoulder and brought
a tiny trickle of blood. “No fool Lodo.”</p>

<p>Bomba read the words twice under Lodo’s direction,
and still the giant was unconvinced. The
other bucks patterned their conduct on his and
crowded around Bomba, muttering and growling
like beasts of the jungle about to close in on a
helpless prey.</p>

<p>“You lie!” The point of Lodo’s knife pricked
again at Bomba’s shoulder, deeper this time, and
a red stream followed it.</p>

<p>Still Bomba did not flinch, giving the sullen
Indian look for look without a sign of fear.</p>

<p>“You lie!” again shouted Lodo, working himself
into a frenzy of fury. “Braves see Hondura
near the hut of Casson, the white medicine man.
Hondura not come back to his people. Bomba
hide Hondura. Bomba must die!”</p>

<p>His knife was upraised in menace. A shudder
of anguish passed through Bomba, but he said no
word. A dozen hands reached out to seize him,
a dozen knives were pointed at his throat——</p>

<p>“Wait!” A guttural voice came from the doorway
of the hut, and Grico, he of the one eye and
the split nose, forced his way through the ring of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
angry Indians. “Let me see writing on the wall.
I tell you if Bomba lie.”</p>

<p>Grico was a native of tremendous physical
strength. He had for a while lived in one of the
towns on the coast, and as a boy had been taken
under the care of an English missionary school.
Here he had been taught the rudiments of education.
But the call of his jungle blood had proved
too strong to be resisted, and he had run away
and thrown in his lot with the Araos tribe.</p>

<p>There, when he reached manhood, he became
known as the swiftest runner and the greatest
hunter of them all. He had lost one eye and
acquired his split nose in a battle with jaguars,
in which he had shown almost superhuman
strength and courage.</p>

<p>He had become therefore a person of great influence
in the tribe, not only because of his prowess
as a hunter but also because of his knowledge of
the world outside and his education, which gave
him great superiority over his ignorant and simple-minded
mates. And he was cunning enough to
make this count for all that it was worth and considerably
more, considering that, after all, he had
gained only the merest smattering of learning.</p>

<p>Bomba knew something of the history of Grico,
and hope sprang in him anew as the giant caboclo
made his way through the sullen group and peered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
at that faint scrawl upon the wall. Slowly he
read the words aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Nascanora is taking away Casson, Pipina,
Hondura to camp near Giant Cataract. Come.
Help.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Then he turned to the Indians, his one eye
gleaming at them in a contemptuous manner.</p>

<p>“Bomba speaks truth,” he said. “Those are
the words he said, and that is the writing on the
wall. Take the point of your knife away, Lodo.
The boy is right. Chief Hondura has been taken
away by the wicked Nascanora. We will capture
Nascanora and tie him to a tree and pile the
brushwood up about his knees and with flint and
stone make red flames that will lick at his flesh
and bones. Ayah! Ayah!”</p>

<p>The cry of vengeance, indescribably weird and
savage, was taken up by the Indians and filled the
jungle with a long wailing shriek that chilled the
blood of Bomba as he thought of what might have
happened to him had it not been for Grico’s timely
appearance.</p>

<p>Once their enmity was turned from him, the
Indians became as friendly and pleasant as they
had been savage a few moments before.</p>

<p>One of them found a bit of native cloth in the
hut and bound it about the wound in Bomba’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
shoulder. Then they squatted outside the hut to
hold a council and decide upon plans for the rescue
of their chief.</p>

<p>While the Indians talked in their guttural language,
sometimes sitting for many minutes of
silence between their laconic sentences, Bomba
fretted and fumed, eager to be once more on the
trail of the headhunters.</p>

<p>However, he could not risk offending Lodo and
his braves, who might prove valuable helpers in
his quest, by going off too abruptly. So he waited,
answering as best he could the questions that Lodo
and Grico put to him from time to time.</p>

<p>He told them of the previous visits of the headhunters
to Casson’s cabin, how he had beaten off
their attacks, how he had wounded Nascanora himself,
how he had captured Ruspak, their medicine
man, and how in the jungle he had overcome the
braves of Tocarora.</p>

<p>“I think there are two bands of headhunters,”
he said, when asked for his opinion. “Nascanora
is at the head of one, and Tocarora, his half-brother,
leads the other. They will join each
other somewhere in the jungle. Then Nascanora
will be strong enough to fight the Araos if they
come looking for their chief.”</p>

<p>“But they did not think of Grico!” said he of
the split nose, his one eye gleaming balefully.
“Grico will get other braves who will fight with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the Araos to get back Hondura. Hondura has
been good to Grico. Grico will show that he is
grateful.”</p>

<p>Bomba knew that this was no idle boast.
Grico’s courage was so well established that he
would have no trouble in rallying many bucks of
other tribes under his leadership. If he could do
this, the Araos and their auxiliaries would prove
formidable enemies, even to the redoubtable headhunters.</p>

<p>But Bomba knew that this would take time and
be the subject of innumerable powwows before
the avengers would get fairly started. And with
the knowledge he had of Casson’s danger he was
in no mood for delay. He must go on. They
could follow later.</p>

<p>He knew the risks he ran in going alone. He
would be only one against the hordes of Nascanora.
But his wit had served him so often where
mere force would have failed that he was willing
and eager to trust to it again.</p>

<p>So when a favorable opportunity presented, he
broached his plan to his new-found allies.</p>

<p>“Bomba will go first and try to find the trail
while Lodo and Grico are getting their braves
together,” he said. “If Bomba finds them near by,
he will come back and tell you, so that you may
come and fight them. If he finds they are far off,
he will leave a trail of his own so that you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
move fast through the jungle. Does Bomba speak
well?”</p>

<p>Lodo and Grico consulted.</p>

<p>“Bomba speaks well—” Lodo was beginning
when there was a sudden commotion in the surrounding
jungle. A moment later a strange company
broke into the clearing.</p>

<p>Bomba saw that they were squaws of the Araos
tribe. The faces of the women, usually so stolid,
wore the ghastly gray of terror. They had come
from afar and swiftly, for their flesh was torn by
thorns and spiked vines and their breath came in
gasps.</p>

<p>One of them, who was the squaw of Lodo and
seemed to be the leader of the women, came over
to her husband and stood before him, striving to
regain breath enough to speak.</p>

<p>“What is it, woman?” cried Lodo. “What has
happened?”</p>

<p>“The maloca,” she got out at last. “Bucks
come. They burn our houses. They carry off
the women. They take the children. All gone.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE SAVAGE RAIDERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> news fell with stunning effect upon the
assembled bucks already wrought up to a high
pitch of fury because of the capture of their chief.
There was a hubbub of exclamations of grief and
rage.</p>

<p>“Pirah gone, too,” declared the woman, with a
sweeping gesture of her hands.</p>

<p>“Pirah!” This was Bomba’s voice, harsh and
unlike his own, as he pushed through the group
of scowling Indians. “You say Pirah taken too?
Who were the bucks?”</p>

<p>“No know.” The squaw shook her head.
She had recovered her breath now, and, with the
other women, was regaining her habitual stolid
look. “They come—many come.” She extended
her ten fingers, closing and opening her hands
several times to indicate an indefinite number.
“Take women. Take children. We run away.
Hide in bushes till they go. Then we come here.”</p>

<p>Her story roused the Indians even more than
the loss of their chief. That their native village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
or maloca, should have been invaded, their women
and children carried off, was a crime that by their
code merited only one punishment, and that torture
and death.</p>

<p>The powwow broke up at once and the braves
hurried away to their maloca, taking their women
with them.</p>

<p>Bomba accompanied them for some distance,
and then took leave of them, promising to pick up
the trail at once and coöperate with them in every
way possible in the rescue of their chief and
kidnapped families, as well as of Casson and
Pipina.</p>

<p>Then he left them to return with heavy and
angry hearts to their despoiled maloca while he
again sought out the path he had been pursuing
when the onrush of Hondura’s enraged braves
had put such an abrupt stop to his journey.</p>

<p>His heart was sorer now than ever, for it was
torture to him to think of the pretty little Pirah,
the daughter of Hondura, who had once succored
him, in the clutches of the evil Nascanora. For
in his own mind Bomba did not doubt that the
same hand that had directed the capture of Hondura
had also ordered the despoiling and burning
of the chief village of the Araos.</p>

<p>Bomba could but remember that on his onetime
visit to the Araos tribe, when his life had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
been in danger from the suspicion of Hondura
and his braves, it had been little Pirah who had
stood between him and a horrible fate, and by her
innocent friendship had changed enmity to confidence
and trust.</p>

<p>Another fact stood out from the story brought
by the Araos squaws. It was that the headhunters
must be present in large force, or they would not
have dared thus to challenge the wrath of the
most powerful native tribe of the district.</p>

<p>Probably the opinion he had voiced to Lodo and
Grico had been the correct one. Nascanora was
probably at the head of one band and Tocarora of
another. The scrawl on the wall had told him
that it was Nascanora in person who had raided
the cabin of Pipina. While he was thus engaged,
Tocarora had probably assailed the maloca.
Later on, the two bands would have met to form
a formidable combination.</p>

<p>If this were true, it would make Bomba’s task
all the harder. But he cared little for this. His
heart was on fire with rage. In his present mood
no danger could daunt him.</p>

<p>Then again he must rescue poor Cody Casson,
no matter how difficult the undertaking. First,
there was the love and gratitude the boy felt for
his benefactor, but if the enemy should kill the old
naturalist, Bomba was afraid that the last hope of
clearing up his own identity—of finding out about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
his father and maybe other relatives—would be
gone forever.</p>

<p>So, having once more picked up his trail, he
went on at a swifter and ever swifter pace, tormented
at every step by fears of what might be
happening at that very moment to his friends at
the hands of the evil chief of the headhunters.</p>

<p>One thought, however, brought him a little
comfort. He knew the boastful nature of the
savages. Nascanora would want to exhibit his
captives to the women of his tribe who had been
left at home. He would be eager to impress them
with his power. They, too, must have their share
in the horrid festival that would end in the torture
and death of most of his victims and the reduction
to slavery of the others.</p>

<p>So the lives of the captives were probably safe
until the headhunters had reached their dwelling-place
above the Giant Cataract. Bomba would be
in time to save them, avenge them, or, at the
worst, to die with them.</p>

<p>Several hours passed and Bomba had made remarkable
progress before he stopped for a few
minutes to rest and eat.</p>

<p>As he felt in his pouch to draw out a portion
of cured meat, he made a startling discovery.</p>

<p>His revolver and harmonica were missing!</p>

<p>Bomba could scarcely believe this at first, nor
accept it as a fact until he had searched every recess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
of his pouch and quiver. He even retraced
his steps for some distance through the jungle, in
the hope that his treasures might have slipped out
and that he could recover them.</p>

<p>But he could find no trace of the magic music
or the precious “fire stick,” and at last he came
back to the clearing to ponder and mourn his loss.</p>

<p>That loss to him was very great. He had so
few treasures that he cherished them fondly. The
harmonica had brought him soothing and comfort
in many lonely hours. The revolver had been
the white men’s gift, and therefore doubly
precious. Moreover, it was a very important
part of his equipment. On occasion it might mean
all the difference between life and death. His
offensive power was sensibly weakened. Now he
had only his knife and his bow and arrows.</p>

<p>But his treasures were gone, in all likelihood
irrecoverably gone. Where and how had he lost
them?</p>

<p>A thought that crossed his mind swiftly changed
his mood from mourning to anger.</p>

<p>He remembered that Grico, he of the one eye
and the split nose, had come close to him and
jostled him several times, as though by accident,
during his journey through the jungle. At the
time, Bomba had thought it chance. Now he saw
in it design. Perhaps it was Grico who had robbed
him of his treasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Grico, to be sure, had saved his life, and for that
Bomba was grateful. The fact modified the anger
that assailed him. Still he vowed that, if his
suspicions were correct, he would get that revolver
and harmonica back. He would pay the debt he
owed Grico in some other way.</p>

<p>He was meditating gloomily upon his loss when
his attention was attracted by a slight rustling
in the underbrush.</p>

<p>Swift as thought, he fitted an arrow to his bow
and stood on the alert.</p>

<p>He could dimly see the form of some animal,
and not knowing but what it might be a jaguar,
he shot. The law of the jungle, he had learned,
was to shoot first and investigate afterward.</p>

<p>There was a startled grunt, a floundering about
in the bushes, and then silence.</p>

<p>Bomba crept forward cautiously, prepared for
a second shot, but relaxed when he saw lying dead
before him a peccary, the wild pig of the jungle.</p>

<p>He was not especially pleased at this, for the
peccaries usually traveled in droves and companions
of the dead one might be near at hand. As a
rule, he gave the animals a wide berth, for nothing
is more ferocious than the peccaries, whose murderous
tusks, if they get to work, can tear a man
into ribbons.</p>

<p>So he waited for a while, close to a tree up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
which he could climb if the drove bore down upon
him.</p>

<p>But none appeared, and Bomba came to the conclusion
that this was a young pig that had wandered
from the drove and lost its way in the
jungle.</p>

<p>The roast pig makes delicious eating, and
Bomba did not neglect the unexpected gift that had
come his way. It offered an agreeable change
from the dried meat on which he had expected to
dine. So he cut a steak from the choicest part,
roasted it over a fire of twigs, and soon was feasting
on a dish that kings might envy.</p>

<p>How he wished that Frank Parkhurst was with
him to share the feast! Before he had met with
the white people he had been lonely, but he had
not so keenly sensed his loneliness. Now it was
ever present with him.</p>

<p>The friendship he had formed with Frank was
the most precious thing that had so far come into
Bomba’s starved life—except, perhaps, the meeting
with the woman of the golden hair, Frank’s
mother.</p>

<p>It had made still more deep and strong the urge
that was on him to hold fellowship with his kind.
For he was white—as white as Frank himself.
Yet fate had thrown the two boys into environments
that were as widely separated as the poles.</p>

<p>Chicago, Frank had called the city in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
lived. Bomba wondered whether he would ever
see that strange and wonderful city or others like
it, wondered if he would always have to spend his
life in the jungle, with none save Casson and a
few natives for his friends, to none of whom he
could speak of the longings that obsessed him, of
the aspirations that seemed doomed forever to be
thwarted.</p>

<p>He spoke to himself half aloud:</p>

<p>“I am not as well off as the beasts and reptiles
of the jungle. They live together and have plenty
of their own kind. They do not hunt and live
alone as I do. The monkeys gather in flocks, the
wild peccaries hunt in droves. Even the big cats,
the hungry jaguars, have their companions. Why
am I, Bomba, always alone? I do not belong
here in the jungle, which is the only place I know.
And I cannot go to the wonderful world where
Frank and other boys and many people live and
laugh and slap each other on the back. Where
do I belong? Where is there a place for me?”</p>

<p>But nothing answered that desolate cry that
came from the very depths of the boy’s heart.</p>

<p>However, Bomba soon aroused himself from
these unhappy musings. A certain oppression and
unusual stillness in the jungle warned him that a
storm was imminent. In the distance he could
hear faintly the rumbling of thunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>He girded himself and resumed his journey, his
heart heavy, but his body refreshed and strengthened
by the hearty meal he had eaten. For some
time he had failed to pick up any direct clues of
those he was pursuing. But he was now reasonably
sure of the direction they had taken and
pressed confidently forward.</p>

<p>His footsteps had been directed toward the
river, since that offered the shortest route to the
region of the Giant Cataract. Now, however, he
struck deeper into the jungle, not caring to be
caught in a raging torrent if the river should overflow
its banks. He remembered how nearly he and
Mrs. Parkhurst had been overwhelmed by the
waters while they were escaping from the Indians,
and he had no wish to repeat the experience.</p>

<p>He quickened his pace, leaping over many of the
obstacles in his path instead of cutting his way
through them. He did not want to be caught in
the open during the storm that seemed to be
gathering. If a wind accompanied it, there would
be a rain of castanha nuts from the branches, and
many of these were big and heavy enough to kill
anyone they struck.</p>

<p>He must find shelter of some kind. He knew
of the existence of a cave not far away. If he
could reach this, he would be safe until the storm
abated. Fortunately the tropical tempests, though
fierce while they last, are not of long duration, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
Bomba knew that he would not be delayed long
on his journey.</p>

<p>The storm was gathering with frightful rapidity.
Now it was a race between the boy of
the jungle and the elements. The roar of the
thunder came closer. Jagged sheets of lightning
shot athwart the sky. The wind tore through the
jungle, shattering the ominous silence that had
prevailed into jangled discords of sound.</p>

<p>The trees bent before that furious onslaught.
Parrots, monkeys and other denizens of the jungle
scurried to shelter.</p>

<p>The castanha nuts were ripped from their fastenings,
and their thuds blended into a menacing
chorus as they struck the ground.</p>

<p>One of these heavy missiles in falling grazed
Bomba’s shoulder, sending a thrill of pain through
his arm.</p>

<p>The cave was now not far away, but the wind
was pressing with terrible force against Bomba’s
straining muscles. Flailing, sharp-thorned vines
whipped about his head, stinging, half-blinding
him. His breath seemed torn from his gasping
lungs, to be borne off mockingly on the wings of
the terrible blasts.</p>

<p>Still Bomba’s muscles were iron and he forged
forward doggedly, ignoring the thorns that tore
at him, the roots that tried to trip him up, the
vines that sought to strangle him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>He was closer—closer—only a short distance
now, and he would be able to drag himself into
the welcome shelter of the cave.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, as the tidal wave tops all other
waves, came a gigantic burst of wind that bore
great trees before it as though they had been toys,
bending them, breaking them, uprooting them,
whirling them about as in a fantastic dance.</p>

<p>The force of that blast bore Bomba backward,
pinning him against a great tree, with all the
breath knocked out of his body. At the same time
there came a ripping, tearing sound, a rumble and
a roar that vied with the crash of the thunder.</p>

<p>Something struck Bomba—he had no time to
see what—swept him from the ground as though
he had been a feather, and dropped him many feet
away with a force that drove all consciousness
from him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>IN DEADLY PERIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bomba slowly came to himself, fighting
his way through unconsciousness, he did not realize
at once the full significance of his plight.</p>

<p>First of all, he knew that he was drenching wet—probably
it had been the beating of rain upon
his face that had brought him back to consciousness.</p>

<p>The heavens had opened, and a deluge of rain
had descended on the jungle, filling the dry beds of
the ygapos as though by magic, overflowing the
banks of the streams so that along their shores
twin torrents raged.</p>

<p>Bomba had been swept by the branches of a
falling tree into a deep hollow in the ground.
The jungle abounded with these miniature pools,
their bottoms only a muddy ooze at most times,
the hollows only full after a rainfall or the overflowing
of some stream in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Bomba wondered dully if he had been seriously
injured, perhaps crushed, in the fall. There was
no feeling in his body, and at first he was too dazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to test his strained muscles. He seemed to himself
like a disembodied ghost.</p>

<p>But as the rain continued to fall upon his upturned
face, fuller consciousness returned to him.
He viewed his situation with more active alarm,
tried to move his hands and feet and raise himself
from his confined position.</p>

<p>This effort ended in a feeling of almost complete
discouragement. His feet and legs were
powerless. They might have been cut from his
body, for all the good they were to him. He could
not even raise himself sufficiently to look and see
if they were still there.</p>

<p>Branches of the fallen tree pinioned him as
securely to the ground as though he had been
bound by iron cords. There was a stifled oppressed
feeling in his chest, and it hurt him to
draw a long breath.</p>

<p>His left arm, seemed dead. It possessed no
more feeling than the lower part of his body. His
right arm and hand seemed numb and almost useless
at the start. The arm was doubled under
him, and Bomba thought it must be broken.</p>

<p>But, by an agonized effort that made the sweat
start from his brow, he managed at last to move
it, ever so slowly and painfully, drawing it by
degrees from under his prostrate body, until that
much of him at least was free.</p>

<p>The blood surged back into the numbed arm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
causing the boy unspeakable agony. But as circulation
was resumed, feeling and power came
back, and Bomba flexed and unflexed his fingers
with a sensation of renewed life.</p>

<p>He was a helpless thing no longer. His right
hand was clear. If he could reach the machete,
drag it free and hack his way through the imprisoning
branches!</p>

<p>But even as he groped for the machete Bomba
discovered something that seemed to turn the
blood in his veins to ice.</p>

<p>The water was rising in the pool!</p>

<p>Until now, this phase of his terrible danger had
not struck Bomba. The painful freeing of his
right hand, the fear that in the fall he might have
sustained an injury that would cripple him and
leave him a prey to the first beast of the jungle
that might roam that way, the dread that he might
never be able to free himself from those ruthless,
imprisoning branches had blinded him to another
and more imminent peril that threatened.</p>

<p>The rain was still torrential, and the pool that
had been for weeks only a muddy depression in
the jungle floor was now filling with water.</p>

<p>If he could not reach his machete with his still
half-numbed right hand and hack his way free
from the branches before the water rose to his
mouth and nose as he lay on his back, Bomba
would die—drown like a rat in a trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>This certainty roused him at once to frantic
effort. By a desperate strain, his hand found its
way to the machete in his belt. The sharp-pointed
twigs of the branch that imprisoned his chest tore
at his flesh cruelly, but Bomba did not even feel
the pain.</p>

<p>It was one thing to die on his feet, fighting to
the last breath, and another to lie there flat on his
back, while the water crept up and up, seeking to
close his nostrils, fill his throat, and deprive him
of life.</p>

<p>He had the machete now, and was hacking
feebly at the nearest branch, for the strength had
not yet come back into his hand and arm. He
succeeded in cutting away some of it. The fragments
brushed aside fell with a sickening splash
into the water.</p>

<p>Slow work! Heart-breaking work! If only
the rain would stop, the torrential downpour
slacken for a while, he might yet get free. But
in the lowering heavens to which Bomba lifted his
anguished eyes there was no hope. It would need
but a short time to fill the pool to overflowing.</p>

<p>The water crept higher, while Bomba slashed
furiously at the confining branches. Steadily,
sections of them came away and dropped into the
muddy water—but not fast enough!</p>

<p>The chill of the rising waters was about his
shoulders now. When his neck tired of holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
his head above the surface, he could feel the
clammy touch upon his ear.</p>

<p>He had cleared away much of that network of
branches. The weight on his chest was lighter.
He could breathe more freely.</p>

<p>He tried to lift himself, but could not. That
dreadful incubus still held him securely.</p>

<p>Chilled to the bone, shivering, he went to work
again. More branches and still more were pushed
aside and dropped into the pool. The lapping of
the water sounded in his ears as though death
were crooning its awful lullaby.</p>

<p>Wearied of holding up his head, his arm one
agonizing ache from the effort of using it in that
strained position, Bomba let himself relax for a
moment and lay back gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Lying there, the water was over his ears, filling
them with a drumming sound. It climbed still
higher, as steady and implacable as fate.</p>

<p>He could not relax like that again without
bringing the water over his eyes, over his nose——</p>

<p>Bomba lifted his head frantically, and, summoning
his last reserve of strength, hacked at the
boughs.</p>

<p>He would not die like that! He would not!
Surely strength would be given him to resist that
awful fate!</p>

<p>And strength was given him—the temporary
strength of a madman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>He knew no fatigue, felt no pain, was conscious
of nothing but the sound and touch of that lapping,
creeping water.</p>

<p>That spasm of superhuman energy was not without
result. It seemed to him that the load on his
chest was lightening. Perhaps he could sit up.</p>

<p>One straining, frantic effort—another— He
fell back, weak and gasping, into the pool.</p>

<p>The waters closed over him with a greedy, sucking
sound and blotted out his face completely.</p>

<p>A trail of tiny bubbles rose to the surface.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>FEROCIOUS FOES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Death had not yet claimed Bomba for his
own.</p>

<p>The water broke and the lad’s face appeared,
ghastly drawn and white. He was not yet conquered.
He would make one more supreme effort.</p>

<p>He drew the blessed air into his lungs. The
veins stood out on his neck, the great muscles in
his shoulders were ridged like whipcords as he
strained to throw the last of the imprisoning
branches from his chest.</p>

<p>If it had not been for his awful desperation,
even his great strength would not have been equal
to the task. As it was, there was a ripping, tearing
sound, and slowly the grip of the branches relaxed,
slowly Bomba forced himself upward, his
face suffused with blood, his breath coming in
short gasps of agony.</p>

<p>Then a great joy flooded his heart. The mass
upon his chest yielded. He sat upright in the
pool. Now he could use his shoulders as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
his arms to free the lower part of his body. And
he had escaped those greedy waters that a moment
before had been sucking at his breath.</p>

<p>He rested for a while, for the effort had exhausted
him; rested, while he drew great draughts
of air into his lungs, luxuriously expanding the
chest that had been so cruelly imprisoned.</p>

<p>He flexed his arms and felt his body carefully
to make sure no bones were broken.</p>

<p>Everything all right there! But his legs were
yet held captive, and there was no feeling in them.
They might be broken, crushed. He could not
tell.</p>

<p>He could work faster now, for the strength of
his back and shoulders went into the quick, sharp
strokes of the machete. One by one the boughs
yielded to his vigorous attacks and were thrown
aside.</p>

<p>The water was still creeping upward in the pool,
but it would be a long time now before it could
reach the danger point. The rain was slackening
too.</p>

<p>Stealing a precious moment to glance upward at
the sky, Bomba saw that the clouds were breaking
and the sun beginning faintly to shine through.
The wind had sunk to a gentle murmuring, and the
last rumblings of the thunder were dying away in
the distance.</p>

<p>Now a foot and leg were free. With more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
heart, Bomba worked at the other, and soon
cleared away the last of the branches.</p>

<p>He could see more clearly now what had happened
to him. A great tree, torn loose by that
last cyclonic burst of wind, had fallen, sweeping
him along with its branches and imprisoning him
in the pool.</p>

<p>Lucky for him, thought Bomba, that the boughs
had caught him instead of the trunk. In the latter
case, there would have been no escape. His life
would have paid toll to the storm.</p>

<p>He felt of his legs, raising them tentatively and
working them till the blood flowed back in their
veins again. To his joy, he established the fact
that no bones were broken, though ligaments and
muscles had been cruelly strained.</p>

<p>Trying to drag himself to his feet, Bomba found
that he could not bear his weight upon them, and
was forced at last to drag himself on hands and
knees out of the pool and onto higher ground.</p>

<p>The jungle was friendly again. Far above, the
sun streamed out through broken clouds. Monkeys
chattered, parrots screamed, and the timid
small creatures once more ventured out from their
hiding places.</p>

<p>In Bomba’s heart was a great thankfulness for
his escape. Yet at the same time he bemoaned the
hurt to his legs, since he could not hasten as quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
as he had hoped to the rescue of Casson, Pipina
and little Pirah.</p>

<p>He dragged himself to his feet, slowly and
painfully, resting half his weight against the trunk
of a tree. He looked down at his legs and found
they were torn and bleeding in a dozen places from
contact with the thorny twigs. The rest of his
body was badly bruised and cut. He would rub
himself with river mud, his sovereign remedy,
as soon as he could walk.</p>

<p>It took some time for the strength to return to
his bruised limbs. And even when he could move
and bear his weight upon them, his gait was no
more than an uncertain wobble.</p>

<p>He was furiously impatient of this infirmity.
In this condition he was as helpless as a wounded
tapir. How easily he could become the prey of
any beast of the jungle that might happen to come
across him!</p>

<p>Bomba shifted his machete from his right hand
to the left and felt for his bow and arrows. They
were gone, torn from him, probably, as the tree
fell upon him.</p>

<p>This was a serious loss, and his heart was filled
with consternation. He made a careful search of
the vicinity, but could find no trace of them.</p>

<p>It was another illustration of the saying that
misfortunes never come singly. First he had been
robbed of his revolver. Now he had lost his bow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and arrows. Only his machete was left to meet
the manifold dangers by which he was surrounded
and for use against the wily Nascanora and his
braves. He wondered grimly how long even his
machete would be left to him.</p>

<p>But he had to make the best of it. Perhaps he
would meet some friendly natives who would
trade him a bow and some arrows for the meat
of the peccary. If not, he would have to shape
the weapons himself with his knife, if he could
find suitable material.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had returned to the pool. There,
scooping up great handfuls of mud, he rubbed it
over his torn and bleeding flesh. Then, impatient
of further delay, he started off through the
jungle in the direction of the Giant Cataract.</p>

<p>He realized at last that he was very hungry,
and, thinking that his weakness was partly due to
this, he took from his pouch some of the roasted
meat and ate with a relish.</p>

<p>He felt refreshed after this, and proceeded at
a much better pace. His limbs still pained him
greatly, and he was forced to stop at frequent
intervals to rest. But he was getting stronger, and
his confidence was returning to him.</p>

<p>His chief concern was the loss of his weapons.
At any moment he might be called upon to use
them in defence. His knife, to be sure, was a
terrible weapon at close quarters. Even at some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
distance he could hurl it with great precision, as
he had on the night when he had sent it whizzing
through the air and buried it in the throat of the
jaguar that was leaping at the white rubber
hunters.</p>

<p>But he saved that as a last resort. His main
dependence had been the bow and arrows, that
might enable him to make a stand even if attacked
by several enemies at the same time.</p>

<p>They were essential, too, in hunting game for
food. But that thought just now gave him little
concern. He could always find jaboty eggs in the
jungle or catch fish in any stream he might encounter.
And at present he was well supplied with
dried meat.</p>

<p>If he had been superstitious, he might have
thought that a malign fate had been following him
ever since he set out on his journey. There was
the loss of his revolver and harmonica, the enforced
return to the hut when Hondura’s braves
had come upon him, the further loss of his bow
and arrows, his submergence in the pool when the
tree had trapped him.</p>

<p>A native would have interpreted these things
as evidence that the gods frowned on his undertaking,
and would have turned back. But they
only increased Bomba’s determination to play the
game out to the end. He thrived on opposition.
What were obstacles for but to be surmounted?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>He traveled on for perhaps an hour. Then he
came to a clearing among the dense underbrush.
He welcomed this as enabling him to make more
rapid progress.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stepped back, startled. There before
him, grazing placidly beneath the heat of the
tropical sun, was a great drove of peccaries, the
fierce wild pigs of the jungle.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, Bomba would have been able to
circle that grazing drove so silently and swiftly
that before they had caught the scent of human
presence he would have been far beyond their
reach.</p>

<p>And that was the most intense desire in Bomba’s
mind at that moment! He had seen natives after
the peccaries had finished with them, and shuddered
at the sight. If they should get at him in the
open, his life would not be worth a moment’s
purchase. This would be true even if he had his
weapons. How much more certain would be his
fate under present conditions!</p>

<p>But Bomba now had not as full control of his
limbs as usual, and he made a slight noise as he
stepped back into the forest fringe.</p>

<p>The peccary nearest him lifted up its wicked,
blunt-nosed head and sniffed the air. Then, with
a snort of rage, it turned in the direction of the
sound and started straight toward Bomba. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
rest of the drove automatically followed their
leader.</p>

<p>There was only one thing to be done. Quick
as thought, Bomba leaped for the limb of the tree
nearest him, swinging his body clear of the ground
just as the first peccary reached the spot where he
had been. The others followed with such headlong
speed that many of them struck against the
trunk of the tree and shook it with their impact.</p>

<p>Not a second too soon, thought Bomba, as he
swung himself from branch to branch until he
reached a fork, where he ensconced himself.</p>

<p>Below him at the base of the tree the peccaries
were acting like things demented. They ran
around and around in circles, snorting viciously
and stumbling over one another in their fury.</p>

<p>Bomba was thankful that pigs were not like
monkeys or jaguars, who were as much at home
among the branches of a tree as they were on the
ground.</p>

<p>The peccaries could not climb, and so were
powerless to vent their rage on Bomba. He was
safe for the present and could smile grimly as they
gnashed their tusks, those terrible tusks that were
like so many knives and which could so easily
slash him to bits.</p>

<p>The boy was filled with resentment against
these ferocious creatures. They could not harm
him, but they were delaying him in his pursuit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Nascanora. For all he knew, they might keep
him treed for days. And in the meantime what
might be happening to the captives? His heart
was wrung with anguish at the thought.</p>

<p>An hour passed—another. Then the fury of
the peccaries began to abate. They were short-sighted,
and used to holding their heads down as
no longer gazing at their enemy, they soon forgot
they grazed. It tired them to look up. And,
his existence. With the stupid peccary, out of
sight was out of mind.</p>

<p>They began to drift away at last, moving aimlessly
as though they had forgotten all about
Bomba and the reason for their ferocious attack.</p>

<p>But Bomba’s forced rest had brought renewed
strength to his limbs, and he felt more like his
own strong, active self.</p>

<p>Still the lad did not dare start his descent until
all of them had vanished from sight. Then,
slowly and cautiously, making as little noise as
possible, he slipped downward through the heavy
branches.</p>

<p>He had reached the lowest bough when something
bade him pause.</p>

<p>Something was watching him from the jungle,
something that he could not see but could feel!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE JAGUARS ATTACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> became suddenly motionless, flattened
against the tree as though he were a part of it.</p>

<p>He did not dare move even to go upward again,
for fear that the hidden enemy would be tempted
to come forth from its hiding place.</p>

<p>Bomba had not lived all his life in close contact
with the beasts of the jungle for nothing. His
sense of smell was almost as well developed as
theirs.</p>

<p>Now this useful sense told him that his enemy
was none other than the big jungle cat, the jaguar,
the most dreaded four-footed denizen of the
jungle.</p>

<p>And there might be more than one of these
ferocious beasts. He knew that they frequently
traveled in pairs. His flesh crawled as the full
helplessness of his position came over him.</p>

<p>There he was without bow or arrow or revolver—his
only weapon the machete. His position
in the tree rendered him all the more helpless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
against the attack of the big cats, for they could
climb more swiftly than could he.</p>

<p>What to do? Where to turn?</p>

<p>There was a stealthy rustling in the bushes, but
as yet Bomba could see nothing. His fingers itched
for the comforting feel of his bow and arrow.
He almost groaned aloud when he thought of his
lost revolver, the cherished “fire stick,” that at
such close quarters could do deadly execution.</p>

<p>The faint rustling drew closer and closer.
From the corner of his eye Bomba glimpsed a
gleaming yellowish-brown body. Beyond this he
could see the dim outline of another.</p>

<p>Two of them! And what chance would he have
even against one?</p>

<p>Sensing his helplessness, the jaguars were gaining
confidence. He could see their eyes now,
glowing like sparks of fire. In a moment they
would abandon cover altogether and begin to climb
the tree.</p>

<p>Bomba could no longer disguise his presence.
The beasts knew that he was there.</p>

<p>So the boy began suddenly to swarm up through
the branches. If he could crawl out upon a slender
bough, so slight that it would barely hold his
weight, there was a possibility that the jaguars
would not dare to venture after him.</p>

<p>It was a frail hope, for Bomba knew that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the jaguar’s blood was up he was relentless in
pursuit of his prey.</p>

<p>Still, Bomba hoped against hope that he at
least might find a better position from which to
use his machete. At any rate, it was his only
chance. So he went higher, and higher, his eyes
searching for a strategic position.</p>

<p>His movement stirred his enemies to action.
They broke from cover as he began to swing himself
upward. A quick glance downward showed
Bomba the swift advance of the lean, hungry
brutes. It would be a race between them to see
which would grasp him first.</p>

<p>Bomba climbed like a monkey, his knife between
his teeth. His progress was lightning swift, fear
lending him added celerity. Below him he could
hear the rustling of leaves, the crackling of small
branches, as the foremost jaguar followed him.</p>

<p>A slender bough stretched before him. Out
on this Bomba crept, feeling it sag beneath his
weight and not knowing but at any moment it
might break and send him to the ground.</p>

<p>A vicious growl behind him caused Bomba to
turn suddenly on his frail perch, nearly losing his
balance as he did so. His eyes searched wildly
for the lithe form of his enemy among the leaves
and branches.</p>

<p>It was not easy to discover the beast at first, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
at the lad’s movement it had flattened itself against
the trunk of the tree, wicked, glittering eyes alone
awake and watchful.</p>

<p>But in a moment Bomba made out the sinuous
figure just below the bough on which he had taken
refuge; caught the glare of those malignant eyes
full upon him.</p>

<p>Winding his limbs about the bending bough and
gripping it powerfully with his left hand, Bomba
drew the machete from his teeth and waited.</p>

<p>Below he could hear the second jaguar climbing
swiftly, breaking off the smaller branches as it
came, all stealth having been abandoned in its
eagerness to share in the kill.</p>

<p>The branch on which Bomba sat bent suddenly
and gave forth an ominous, crackling sound. The
first jaguar had moved upward and had put out a
tentative paw to test the strength of the branch.</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart pounded as though it would force
its way through his ribs. In a few moments now
he would know whether he was to live or die. And
with those relentless man-eaters on his track, the
odds were all in favor of death. Even if he were
able to beat off one of the beasts, the other would
be on him at once and avenge its mate.</p>

<p>The instinct of the nearer brute told it that the
bough on which Bomba rested would not support
the weight of two bodies. So it chose a heavier
one just below that on which the boy was perched,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and began to creep out upon it, tail switching and
jaws dripping greedily.</p>

<p>Bomba watched its progress with the same sense
of helplessness he had sometimes felt in nightmares.
Death was separated from him only by
feet. A few moments more and the feet would be
reduced to inches.</p>

<p>Oh, for his bow and arrows! Oh, for the “fire
stick” that would have so quickly turned the tables
on his foe! They would have given him at least
a chance for life. Now his chance was not one in
a hundred.</p>

<p>The jaguar crept out still farther upon its
branch, ears flattened back against its head, cruel
teeth showing in a snarl of fury.</p>

<p>Bomba’s fingers tensed about the handle of the
machete and he shouted, hoping to disconcert the
animal and perhaps make it lose its balance.</p>

<p>But this availed nothing. At the sound of
Bomba’s voice the great beast gave a snarl of rage
and lifted its huge paw, armed with terrible claws
that could strip the flesh from the lad’s body.</p>

<p>Bomba met the vicious stroke halfway with a
slash of his machete. The jaguar howled with
rage and pain. The cut maddened it. With a
ferocious growl it crouched to spring.</p>

<p>It was then that what seemed a miracle happened!</p>

<p>Bomba, in whose heart despair had entered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
who thought that this was his last moment on
earth, saw the body of the ferocious beast leap
suddenly into the air, grasp wildly at anything
that promised a foothold, and then plunge downward
through the branches to the ground.</p>

<p>“Help has come!” thought Bomba, scarcely
able to believe his eyes and almost dropping the
dripping machete from his hand in the agitation
that possessed him. But from where and from
whom?</p>

<p>He heard expressions of jubilation, and two
dark-skinned men appeared beneath the tree.</p>

<p>They were bending over the lifeless cat that had
been pierced through with an arrow, when a rustling
among the branches and a low growl warned
Bomba that the second jaguar had turned its attention
to its new foes and was about to attack.</p>

<p>He could see the brute crouched among the
branches, ready to spring upon the two men at the
foot of the tree.</p>

<p>“Back! Back into the jungle!” he shouted.</p>

<p>The men had barely time to jump back before
the jaguar sprang.</p>

<p>The great vicious ball of fur struck the ground
with a thud, not ten feet away from Bomba’s
rescuers, and crouched to spring.</p>

<p>But before it could launch itself into the air two
bows twanged. One shot missed, but the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
arrow caught the beast full in one gleaming, murderous
eye and pierced to the brain.</p>

<p>The brute gave a few convulsive struggles and
then straightened out beside its mate.</p>

<p>The situation had changed with the quickness of
a kaleidoscope. The would-be killers had themselves
been killed just at the moment that their
victory had seemed assured.</p>

<p>But by whom had their death been brought
about? Were these newcomers friendly or hostile
to Bomba? The thought came to the boy that
they might be of the party of headhunters. If so,
he might have escaped death in one form to meet
it in another even more terrible.</p>

<p>But as he hesitated, he heard their voices more
clearly and recognized them. Then he waited no
longer.</p>

<p>He slid hurriedly to the ground and came face to
face with Ashati and Neram, the former slaves
of Jojasta, the medicine man of the Moving
Mountain!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE MAD MONKEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ashati</span> and Neram dropped to their knees before
Bomba, clasping his hands and bowing their
black heads before him. Neram, bending lower,
took one of Bomba’s sandaled feet and placed it
on his neck as a sign that he was slave and Bomba
master.</p>

<p>The heart of the lonely boy swelled at this sign
of gratitude and affection. He stooped and raised
the kneeling men, and made them stand on their
feet before him.</p>

<p>“You have saved Bomba’s life,” he said with
deep feeling. “If you had not come when you did
the jaguars would have killed him. Bomba will
not forget.”</p>

<p>“Ashati and Neram would have been nothing
now but bones buried in the heart of the Moving
Mountain if you had not come to their help,” replied
Ashati, who seemed to be the spokesman for
the two. “You saved them from death, and
freed them from the cruel yoke of Jojasta, the
medicine man. Ashati and Neram have no master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
but Bomba, and will go anywhere in the jungle at
the side of Bomba as his slave. Their lives belong
to Bomba.”</p>

<p>“You shall go with me wherever I go,” replied
Bomba. “But you shall go as my friends and not
as my slaves. Bomba has nothing to offer you but
friendship. If you will take that and go with him,
he will be glad.”</p>

<p>So it was settled, and with many more expressions
of gratitude and devotion on the part
of the ex-slaves of Jojasta, Bomba and the two
men set to work to skin and quarter one of the
dead jaguars that had unwittingly furnished them
a feast.</p>

<p>While engaged in this and the building of a fire
for the roasting of the best portions of the meat,
Ashati and Neram imparted to Bomba news that
he was anxious to hear.</p>

<p>In their wanderings they had noted the bands of
Nascanora and his half-brother, Tocarora, heading
in the direction of the Giant Cataract. This
had been only two days before and not far from
the place where they were now standing. From
their hiding place in the brush, the slaves had seen
that each party had with it a number of captives.</p>

<p>“Was there a white man among them?” asked
Bomba eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ashati; “an old man, very thin
and with white hair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Bomba’s heart leaped. Casson then was still
alive! He had not succumbed to the hardships
of the journey.</p>

<p>“Can you take Bomba to the place where you
saw them and point out to him the way they were
going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ashati. “But they must be a
long way from there now, for they were going
fast. And they kept looking behind them as
though they thought men were coming after
them.”</p>

<p>The news set Bomba on fire with impatience to
be off. Under his urging and example, the roasting
of the meat was swiftly completed. He divided
the food equally between the three of them.
Whatever might happen to them in the future, it
was certain that they would not starve.</p>

<p>After they had got fairly started, with Ashati
as guide, toward the spot where the path of the
slaves had crossed that of the savages, Bomba
narrated to his companions some of his experiences
since he had left the hut of Pipina.</p>

<p>When he came to the part that concerned the
loss of his bow and arrows, Ashati insisted that
the boy should take his and that he, Ashati, could
do very well with his hunting knife. Besides, he
would make another set of weapons at their first
resting place.</p>

<p>Bomba would have refused, but seeing that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
could not do so without hurting the feelings of the
devoted fellow, at last accepted the gift.</p>

<p>“It was an arrow from that bow that found
the heart of the jaguar that would have sunk its
claws in your flesh and ripped it from the bones,”
said Ashati, as he handed it over.</p>

<p>“Bomba has not asked you yet how it was you
came just in time to save his life,” said the lad.</p>

<p>“We hunted Bomba day and night,” Ashati replied.
“Our lives were yours, for you had saved
them. We came on your trail in the jungle, and
followed after. Ashati saw you in the tree as the
jaguar lifted its paw to strike. Then Ashati
prayed to the Spirit of the Jungle and shot his
arrow. The Spirit made it go straight, and the
jaguar died.”</p>

<p>It was now late afternoon, and Bomba and his
followers had not traveled far before the swift
tropic night descended on them and forced them
to rest for the night.</p>

<p>Bomba chafed at the necessity, though he himself
was almost exhausted in mind and body by
the stirring events of the day that had taxed
both to the utmost.</p>

<p>He was up with the dawn, however, and,
rousing Ashati and Neram, summoned them to
share his hasty breakfast and start on the day’s
journey. They obeyed with willingness, though
no more than half awake. Their bodies wasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and their strength sapped by years of deprivation
and torments at the hands of Jojasta could not
throw off the fatigue as readily as the healthy
jungle lad, whose veins were pulsing with vitality.</p>

<p>But Bomba’s quest of Nascanora could not wait.
Delay, however slight, might result in the death
of his friends, if indeed they still lived. If Ashati
and Neram could travel at Bomba’s pace, he
would be glad to have them with him, for they
were companions in his loneliness and allies in case
of danger.</p>

<p>But if they could not keep up with him, he
would have to go on ahead, leaving them to join
him when they could.</p>

<p>But once roused, they seemed as eager as
himself to continue the journey. Even the prospect
of an encounter with Nascanora and his
braves did not deter them, as long as they were
under Bomba’s leadership. What they had already
seen of him had led them to attribute to
him almost magical power. Their anxiety to
please and serve the lad in every way they could
deeply touched Bomba, in whose life loyalty and
service of any kind had been so sadly lacking.</p>

<p>They stamped out the embers of the fire they
had built to keep off the jungle beasts during the
night, ate of their supply of jaguar meat, and
struck onward through the forest in the direction
of the Giant Cataract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The sun rose higher, and with full daylight came
a fresh burst of speed on the part of Bomba. If
Ashati and Neram found it hard to keep up with
him, they did not murmur. They would have
suffered any hardship rather than be left behind
by him whom they had chosen as their master.</p>

<p>They traveled all day without meeting with any
unusual adventure, pausing only briefly at noon
to roast some jaboty eggs they found in the forest
that gave a welcome variation to their meat diet.</p>

<p>The shadows were beginning to gather when
they came at last to the spot where the paths of
the slaves and the two parties of headhunters had
crossed.</p>

<p>The trail of the Indians was cold, but it was
not difficult for one so versed in woodcraft as
Bomba to pick it up. There was still a little daylight
remaining, and he persisted in utilizing every
moment of it to gain another mile or two before
he called a halt for the night.</p>

<p>On and on they went, although by this time they
were nearly stumbling with fatigue. They were
penetrating a part of the jungle that was new to
Bomba. Pools, swelled by the recent rain, were
frequent, some of them so deep that it was necessary
to cross them by notched trunks of trees, the
crude bridges of the jungle.</p>

<p>Crossing one of these, Ashati, wearied almost
to fainting, stumbled and would have fallen had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
not Bomba seized him and dragged him to the
safety of the further bank.</p>

<p>They had gone but a few yards farther, Bomba’s
eyes straining to detect the faintly marked
trail, when there was a thud, and on the ground
before them, directly in their path, appeared a
figure so grotesque in form and ugly in face that
Bomba took a startled step backward and the
two slaves fell to the ground in a fit of shuddering
terror.</p>

<p>“The mad monkey!” chattered Neram, and
then, as the creature advanced on them, uttered
an ear-piercing shriek.</p>

<p>Gibbering and mouthing ferociously, froth
slavering from its jaws, the huge ape sprang
toward Bomba and the cowering slaves.</p>

<p>Bomba was paralyzed at first by the hideous
appearance of the beast and infected to some degree
with the superstitious terror that animated
Ashati and Neram. He seemed bereft of the
power of movement.</p>

<p>Then gathering together his forces, he sprang
backward swiftly and fitted an arrow to his bow.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>BESET BY ENEMIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> as Bomba drew his arrow to its head he
found that he felt a strange unwillingness to inflict
injury on this antagonist.</p>

<p>The monkeys were his friends. Often they had
helped him when other foes, much more like
Bomba in form and appearance, had sought to
take his life. He could not forget how the swarm
of monkeys had turned the tide of battle in his
fight with Nascanora and his braves when they
had attacked the cabin.</p>

<p>So Bomba called to this slavering, hideous
object in the language of the monkeys, trying to
show that he was not an enemy.</p>

<p>But if anything, the aspect of the ape became
still more fierce and threatening. It uttered a
shrill cry and sprang at the lad with hairy arms
outstretched to grasp him.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram gave a shout of warning, and
seeing that their young leader was in grave danger,
conquered their fear and sprang to his help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>The bow of the jungle boy sang with a twanging
sound as the arrow sped from it. But the attack
of the monkey was so swift that the arrow, instead
of entering the heart as Bomba had intended,
pierced the flank of the brute.</p>

<p>With a howl of pain and rage, the great ape
plucked out the arrow, and swung around upon
Bomba with the bloody point of the weapon upraised.</p>

<p>But Bomba was quicker than the ape. He
sprang aside and, drawing his machete from his
belt, struck the animal’s arm a blow that cut deep
and caused the blood to spurt into the distorted
face of his assailant.</p>

<p>The arrow dropped clattering to the ground,
and with a weird and terrible howl the ape swung
itself with its uninjured arm into the branches of
a tree and vanished into the depths of the jungle.</p>

<p>Trembling, Ashati and Neram faced Bomba in
that uncanny twilight. For a while they said
nothing, but stood staring solemnly at each other.</p>

<p>It was Bomba who first broke the silence, and
in the deep stillness of the shadow-filled jungle his
voice sounded hollow in his own ears.</p>

<p>“The mad monkey! If he is alone, all will be
well. But if there are others——”</p>

<p>“There are others,” interrupted Ashati. “One
mad monkey needs but bite another, and that one
too will become mad. It is in that way the evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
spirits get possession of a flock of monkeys and
set loose a thousand demons upon the jungle.”</p>

<p>“And the bite of one sets loose an evil spirit
within ourselves, and we become even as the mad
monkeys,” said Neram, his teeth chattering.</p>

<p>Bomba knew that he spoke truly. A kind of
hydrophobia would sometimes be communicated
by a snake-bitten monkey to its mates, and by
them to any human being that came within their
reach while the epidemic was raging. He had
known of whole flocks of monkeys having been
decimated before the terrible disease had run its
course. And at such times there was no inhabitant
of the jungle to be so much feared as a mad
monkey.</p>

<p>“We cannot stay here,” said Bomba, looking
about him. “We must go on. Perhaps we shall
find shelter, a cave or an abandoned hut of a
caboclo, where we can spend the night and leave
this terrible place with the daylight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must go on,” agreed Ashati, and
Neram nodded his head in agreement. “To stay
here would be to bring that hurt monkey back for
his revenge.”</p>

<p>“With good fortune we may escape the notice
of others of the flock, since it is night and they may
sleep,” suggested Neram.</p>

<p>“Then we must make no more noise than the
foot of the jaguar,” warned Bomba, and, turning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
he sped silently and swiftly from the place, followed
closely by his companions.</p>

<p>They had proceeded only a short distance when
a horrible chattering overhead caused them to
look up, and in the branches of a tree they saw
two big apes gibbering and grinning at them, with
the same awful look in their eyes that had marked
the first one they had encountered.</p>

<p>As the little party moved swiftly on, a large
castanha nut struck Ashati on the shoulder with
such force that he was felled to the ground.</p>

<p>Bomba lifted him to his feet and hurried him
onward just as a bombardment of the heavy missiles
came pelting down. A hideous wailing and
a sharp, crackling sound like a crazy laugh followed
the three fugitives as they raced onward.</p>

<p>By this time, superstitious terror had taken
complete possession of Ashati and Neram, and
Bomba himself could feel the hair rising on his
head. The swift-falling darkness, the knowledge
that danger was all about them, that insane enemies
were skulking perhaps behind a tree, leering
at them from branches overhead, crouching in ambush
behind a concealing bush or shrub, at any
moment to reach out a hairy arm—all these things
combined to fill them with terror.</p>

<p>Their flight was unreasoning. They plunged
through thorn bushes that tore at their flesh, and
felt no pain. They stumbled and fell into black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
ooze that might hold writhing snakes, and scarcely
thought of it. To put distance between themselves
and this nightmare became their only aim.</p>

<p>Once a terrible figure dropped upon the neck of
Ashati from the branches above. The native gave
a dreadful shriek and threw himself upon his face.</p>

<p>The mad beast catapulted from the shoulders
of Ashati and fell at the feet of Bomba. It was
the work of a moment for the lad to sink his
machete to the handle into the hairy body. The
thing crouched as though to spring, then gave a
ghastly screech and sprawled upon the ground.</p>

<p>“He is dead?” asked Neram, coming forward,
unbelieving.</p>

<p>At the words, the prostrate Ashati raised himself
on hands and knees and crawled over to where
the lifeless brute was lying.</p>

<p>“Dead!” he gasped, and dragging himself to his
feet stared hard at Bomba.</p>

<p>For it was a superstition among the natives
that a mad creature was possessed of an evil spirit
that made it immune to death. The fact then that
Bomba had killed one of the mad monkeys so
easily filled them with surprise and hope. If he
had killed one, he might kill many. Their weapons
were not as powerless as they had feared.</p>

<p>But their relief was swiftly changed to fear
by a strange, weird rustling among the trees that
swelled in volume as they listened, as though a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
great storm had entered the jungle and was sweeping
all before it. But there was no storm nor sign
of one.</p>

<p>“The mad monkeys!” whispered Bomba.
“They have told each other that we are here.
They know that we are few and they are many.
Come!”</p>

<p>If their flight had betrayed panic earlier, it was
nothing to the fear that now gave wings to their
feet. They might hold their own against a few.
They could not face an army, such as, from the
sounds, now seemed to be in pursuit of them.</p>

<p>But even then Bomba had no hate against his
pursuers, such as he felt toward jaguars and
snakes. He pitied them as the suffering victims
of a terrible disorder. None the less, he knew
that they were bent on taking his life and that if
it came to a combat it was a case of kill or be
killed.</p>

<p>There was but one hope, and that a slender one;
the hope that they might find some cave or other
shelter in which they could barricade themselves
and hold the maddened animals at bay. He knew
of no such place in that vicinity, and even if he
had, it would have been difficult to find it in the
dark.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram, with what breath they had,
were muttering prayers to the Spirit of the Jungle.
If ever help was needed, it was needed then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Onward they plunged through the black night
of the jungle, that terrible rustling as of a mighty
wind coming closer and closer with every moment.</p>

<p>As the pursuing monkeys drew closer to their
prey, they began to howl and jabber horribly. It
seemed to Bomba that the whole jungle was one
hideous jangle of sound.</p>

<p>Neram screamed. A hairy arm had reached
from a low-hanging branch, encircling his neck.
He struck at it with his knife and stumbled after
Bomba and Ashati.</p>

<p>They were panting, spent. In another moment
that awful swarm of maddened beasts would descend
upon them.</p>

<p>Stumbling blindly on, Bomba felt his foot slip
into a hollow at the same time that his body
struck violently against a hard substance.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hands and felt rather than
saw in the darkness that he had come to the entrance
of a cave.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he gasped, stepping back and nearly
falling over the cowering form of Neram. “Into
the cave! Quick!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>LYING IN AMBUSH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two slaves seemed not to hear Bomba.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were half dead from fright, or
perhaps they thought that the malady that had
attacked the monkeys had disordered Bomba’s
mind as well.</p>

<p>Despite his command, they continued to crouch
stupidly close to the ground, striving to keep out
of reach of the clutching hands that swung from
the branches overhead.</p>

<p>One great ape dropped to the ground and came
swiftly toward them on all fours, uttering howl
after howl, so wild and eerie that it froze the
blood in the veins of the adventurers.</p>

<p>Finding that the slaves were too terrified to
heed his orders, Bomba seized Neram, who was
nearer to him, and flung him bodily through the
opening of the cave. He took Ashati by the arm
and dragged him forward, shouting:</p>

<p>“The cave! The cave! Do you hear what I
say? Get inside quick, and I will follow.”</p>

<p>From inside the cave Neram reached out a hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
and drew Ashati within the sheltering blackness.</p>

<p>As Bomba was about to follow, the monkeys,
following the leadership of the great ape that had
begun the actual attack, dropped to the ground and
swarmed toward Bomba.</p>

<p>The boy leaped for the gaping mouth of the
cave just as the first of the monkeys grazed his
arm with its paw.</p>

<p>Neram and Ashati dragged him further into
the depths of the cavern, while, with a shriek of
rage, the baffled monkey, seeking to follow,
dashed instead into the rock surface at the side.</p>

<p>Bomba stubbed his foot, bruising it as he fell
forward into the cave. He stooped down to examine
the object and found that it was a great
rock.</p>

<p>“Come, help me!” he cried to the two slaves,
who were fully awake now to the fact that there
was hope of escape.</p>

<p>They stooped to aid him, and as the monkeys
recovered from their surprise at the sudden disappearance
of their enemies and began to search
out the entrance to the cave, those within rolled the
great stone to the entrance, fairly blocking it.</p>

<p>While they held that stone in place they were
safe.</p>

<p>Bomba and his companions sank down on the
ground, gasping for breath, and pressed their
weight against the rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>The weird howling of the enraged monkeys
outside their shelter made them tremble even
now, lest their cunning foes should find some other
entrance to the cave and come pouring in to indulge
in massacre.</p>

<p>But as time passed and they remained unmolested
in their retreat, while the awful howling of
the monkeys died down to a mere jumble of sound,
they began to take courage and hope that all
would still be well with them.</p>

<p>Bomba had feared at first that the cave might
be the lair of some wild beast of the jungle.</p>

<p>But the fact that the stone was so near the
mouth of the cave and was evidently intended to
block up the entrance seemed to argue human occupation.
Some native, perhaps, had become an
outlaw from his tribe and had chosen the cave as
his home.</p>

<p>When it became certain that the monkeys had
tired of their quest and were straggling off again
into the jungle, Bomba ventured to make a
cautious tour of the cave to make sure that his
guess had been correct.</p>

<p>Even then he was afraid that at any moment his
fingers might touch something warm and alive
but not human.</p>

<p>However, the cave was a small one, and he
soon found, to his great relief, that, save for
Ashati, Neram and himself, it was unoccupied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Tired beyond words, but jubilant at their escape,
Bomba returned to the two, who still
squatted on the ground close to the stone that
guarded the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>Ashati was inclined to indulge in prophecy.</p>

<p>“The Spirit of the Jungle is good,” he stated,
as Bomba threw himself down beside them.
“Twice it has saved the life of Bomba. The
captives of the wicked Nascanora and his half-brother
Tocarora will be spared. Bomba will
live to seek out Sobrinini, and find from her the
secret that the poor old white man cannot tell.
It is for that that the Spirit of the Jungle has
twice saved the life of Bomba.”</p>

<p>“Ahma,” said Neram, which meant “so be it,”
as he bowed his head reverently.</p>

<p>It was not long before all three were asleep,
stretched on the ground against the great rock, so
that the slightest push on it would be certain to
rouse them.</p>

<p>But they were undisturbed all through the long
hours of the night, and at dawn awoke, refreshed
and ravenous for the great chunks of roasted
jaguar meat they had prepared the day before.</p>

<p>They ate quickly, listening meanwhile for any
sounds from the jungle which might warn them
of a further attack on the part of the mad
monkeys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>But, aside from the ordinary jungle noises,
everything was as quiet as they could wish. Unless
they were still slyly watched by their enemies,
their escape from the cave should be a matter of
no great difficulty.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, both Neram and Ashati were reluctant
to leave the friendly shelter of the cave,
and urged that Bomba rest there another day and
night until all danger should be gone.</p>

<p>But Bomba would not listen to this.</p>

<p>“You stay,” he said. “But Bomba must go.
If, as you say, it was the Spirit of the Jungle that
twice saved his life yesterday, the Spirit might be
angry if Bomba were afraid and perhaps the next
time would not save him from the hairy arm of
the great ape or the sharp claws of the jaguar.
No, Bomba must go.”</p>

<p>So, seeing that he was in earnest and thinking
that if the lad were under the protection of the
Spirit of the Jungle they would be also, Neram
and Ashati said nothing more and helped Bomba
roll the great stone from the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>“Where you go we will go,” said Ashati gently,
as the welcome sunlight streamed in. “Though
you will not have us for your slaves, you are our
master. Let Bomba start and we will follow.”</p>

<p>Making no sound, they went swiftly through the
jungle and did not pause or stop to rest until
they had put a great distance between them and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the scene of the fantastic nightmare adventure
of the evening before.</p>

<p>When the sun was high above their heads and
all the jungle seemed to fry and crackle beneath
the heat of it, Bomba and his companions sat down
to eat the last of the jaguar meat and some berries
and nuts they had gathered by the way. Farther
back they had found a stream of clear, cool water,
where they had slaked their thirst.</p>

<p>They resumed their route and had not gone far
before they heard the sound of rushing waters.
The sound lent wings to Bomba’s feet, and the
faithful slaves kept pace with him, no matter how
fast he went.</p>

<p>They came out soon on the banks of a river.
The noise of the foaming waters had been growing
louder and louder until now it smote upon their
ears like thunder. A torrent of black water
dashed along the river bed and leaped angrily
against the rocks that studded its course, flinging
a shower of spray upon Bomba and his companions
where they stood at the edge of the fringe of
trees that bordered the river.</p>

<p>“The River of Death!” muttered Ashati in
hushed tones. “It is so that our people call it.”</p>

<p>“And it is well named,” said Neram, making a
cabalistic sign as though to ward off evil.</p>

<p>“Beyond the River of Death,” said Bomba in a
voice of impatience, “though so far away that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
eye cannot see it, is the Giant Cataract. Come,
let us be quick. Nascanora and his braves cannot
be far away.”</p>

<p>They started again, following the course of the
stream. Suddenly Neram paused with his head
to one side as though he were listening.</p>

<p>“Hark!” he said, when Bomba would have
questioned him. “Someone comes.”</p>

<p>As soon as the words had fallen from his lips,
Bomba threw himself upon the ground and put his
ear to it.</p>

<p>Instantly he was on his feet again, drawing
Ashati and Neram within the shelter of the trees,
which at that point were growing in great profusion.</p>

<p>“We will watch as silently as the jaguar watches
for his prey,” he hissed. “Let no one move or
make a sound.”</p>

<p>Hidden by the rank marsh grass that formed a
perfect covert, the three lay motionless, not a
breath betraying their hiding place.</p>

<p>For what seemed a long time to the intent
watchers, no one appeared in sight. For all that
could be seen, the jungle was free from all human
presence and given over to its animal inhabitants.</p>

<p>Unseen himself from the bank of the river,
only a few yards away, Bomba could yet have a
perfect view of any living thing that might pass
by. Absolutely still, as motionless as though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
were an image of stone, his eyes alone moved to
show that he lived and breathed.</p>

<p>The faint sound of footsteps that they had
heard gradually became more distinct, and at last
a solitary traveler came into view. The man was
an Indian, but of a tribe with which Bomba was
not familiar. He was journeying swiftly when
those concealed in the long grass caught their first
glimpse of him, glancing again and again over his
shoulder as though he feared pursuit.</p>

<p>Motioning to Neram and Ashati to remain
silently where they were, Bomba wriggled through
the underbrush as sinuously as a snake. Not a
motion of the grass betrayed his presence.</p>

<p>Then, without a sound, as though he had risen
from the heart of the earth, Bomba leaped to his
feet directly in the path of the unsuspecting native.</p>

<p>The fellow started back and opened his mouth
to yell, but before a sound could issue from it
Bomba had clapped one lean, brown hand over
his mouth and with the other had thrown him
prone on the ground.</p>

<p>Kneeling on the chest of his captive, who was
too paralyzed by the suddenness of the attack to
make more than a feeble resistance, Bomba called
softly to Ashati and Neram. As though, like
Aladdin, he had conjured them by the rubbing of
a lamp, they were instantly at his side.</p>

<p>At their unexpected appearance, the feeble resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of the native ceased altogether. He
seemed to be stupefied with terror, and stared
from one to the other of his captors with red and
watery eyes that begged for mercy.</p>

<p>“We will not hurt you,” said Bomba, taking his
hand from his prisoner’s mouth while at the same
time he motioned Neram and Ashati to grasp the
fellow, should he seek to break away. “Only tell
us what you know and you shall go free. But lie
to us,” he added, with a significant motion toward
his machete, “and you die!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE ISLAND OF SNAKES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> native writhed and twisted, the eyes bloodshot
with terror at the threat.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram came a step nearer with
menace in their eyes, and the captive subsided
again, gasping and groaning beneath the pressure
of Bomba’s knee upon his chest.</p>

<p>“Do not kill me! Only do not kill me!” he
jabbered. “I will answer you! You have only to
ask.”</p>

<p>“Then listen to me, and listen well.” The
fierce, impatient note was in Bomba’s voice again.
“Nascanora, the great chief, the chief with a
black heart, is the man I want to find. Give me
news of him and you shall go free.”</p>

<p>A gleam of hope came into the prisoner’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I will tell. I will tell you anything
I know. But you must not let Nascanora know
that I have told, or he will cut my heart and fry
it over a fire.”</p>

<p>“Nascanora shall not know,” broke in Bomba,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
as he lightened somewhat his pressure on the
man’s chest and bored him through and through
with his eyes as though to wrench the truth from
him. “But if you speak with a forked tongue your
place will be with the dead.”</p>

<p>“I will make straight talk,” asseverated the
native. “I do not want to die.”</p>

<p>“Where is Nascanora? Quick!” demanded
Bomba.</p>

<p>“In two days’ time,” replied the trembling
native, “he will pass this spot on the other side
of the river.”</p>

<p>“I thought he had already passed,” said Bomba.</p>

<p>“He has,” returned the native. “But he turned
back to burn another village and take some more
captives. He will move slowly, for he has other
enemies that he wants to capture near Snake
Island, where lives the old witch, Sobrinini——”</p>

<p>Bomba cried out in astonishment and quick
hope.</p>

<p>“You know Sobrinini?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>The native marked his change of tone, and
seemed encouraged by it. His terror abated, and
he spoke so swiftly that the words stumbled over
each other and Bomba could scarcely make out
what he said.</p>

<p>“I know of Sobrinini. Who does not know of
her who lives near the Giant Cataract?” he cried.
“But I do not go near her island, for it is full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
snakes and Sobrinini is a woman of evil whose
frown means death.”</p>

<p>“Where is this island?” Bomba asked in a fever
of eagerness.</p>

<p>“It is called Snake Island. But to go there is
to die.”</p>

<p>The native shivered with a superstitious terror
as he spoke the words.</p>

<p>Bomba glanced at Ashati and Neram, who had
been listening with absorbed interest to the story
of the native and on whose faces was reflected the
same look of fright.</p>

<p>Bomba released his hold upon the prisoner and
arose to his feet.</p>

<p>“There are two things I must know,” he said.</p>

<p>“Command, and you shall be obeyed,” returned
the native humbly.</p>

<p>“Was there a white man among Nascanora’s
captives?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say. He had many captives and he
will return as I have said. That is all that the
jungle has told me.”</p>

<p>“How do you go to this island where the witch
woman, Sobrinini, lives with her snakes?” asked
Bomba, feeling that the native had spoken the
truth.</p>

<p>The native looked at him with curiosity dawning
in his reddened eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“You will not go there?” he cried in horror.
“I tell you it would be better for you to go to
the giant anaconda and let him wind his coils about
your body than to seek out Sobrinini on her island
that lies under the curse of the gods. I tell you
again that to go there is to die.”</p>

<p>“That is for me to say,” replied Bomba. “I
do not fear Sobrinini. I do not fear her snakes.
I have come a far way to see her and I will see
her. Tell me what I want to know. Bomba does
not like to ask a thing twice.”</p>

<p>In response to this imperative demand, the
native jabbered out directions, telling Bomba the
course he must take to reach Snake Island if he
did not wish to be swept to destruction by the
rapids of the River of Death.</p>

<p>When Bomba had extracted all the information
he could, he motioned the native to rise to his feet.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he said. “If I were Nascanora I
would kill you, so as to be sure that your tongue
would be still. But Bomba’s heart is not black
like that of the chief of the headhunters. I am
going to let you go free. But if you tell anyone
that you have seen me you will find that Bomba’s
knife is sharp and his vengeance is swift. Go now
and remember what I say.”</p>

<p>After the man had disappeared, Bomba wasted
little time in discussing the matter with his companions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
For if he were to accomplish all he
hoped to before Nascanora should pass that way,
he would have to work hard and fast.</p>

<p>He was in a ferment of eagerness to visit Sobrinini
and wrest from the strange woman the
secret of his birth. He was sure she knew. Jojasta
had said she could tell him. Casson’s queer
actions when the name of Sobrinini had been mentioned
and his statement that “Nini would know”
had further confirmed his conviction.</p>

<p>As for the terrors that, according to the native,
barred access to her, he cared not at all. He was
used to meeting and overcoming danger. He
would face anything rather than once more be
balked in learning what to him was almost as much
as life itself.</p>

<p>With the aid of Neram and Ashati, he cut
down one of the smaller trees near the river bank
and began the work of hollowing out a portion of
the trunk in the form of a small canoe.</p>

<p>It was hard work and slow, even with the aid
of his companions, who were skilled in that kind
of work, and when the evening shadows fell along
the banks of the River of Death the canoe was
only half done. Impatient as he was, Bomba was
forced to wait till morning for the completion of
the work.</p>

<p>At the break of dawn Bomba was at work again.
Ashati helped him, while Neram went off in search<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of jaboty eggs so that they could conserve their
remaining supply of meat.</p>

<p>Some time later he returned, triumphantly displaying
six large eggs.</p>

<p>“There were more there, but I could not carry
them,” he said, as he built a fire with which to
prepare breakfast. “I saw a tapir, too, but could
not kill him because I had gone out without my
bow and arrows.”</p>

<p>“Foolish one to hunt without weapons,” reproved
Ashati, looking up for a moment from his
work. “Ashati would know better.”</p>

<p>“The next time Ashati shall do the hunting,”
returned Neram, and went on stolidly with his
preparations.</p>

<p>By the time the sun was high in the heavens the
crude canoe was finished. A paddle was then fashioned
from a sapling, that for all its slenderness
was strong enough to breast the current of even
that raging river.</p>

<p>Their temporary captive had explained to
Bomba that he must launch his boat at some little
distance up the river, where the current was not so
strong. From there he could let himself go with
the rushing waters until he came to a place where
the waters widened out and were not so
tumultuous.</p>

<p>When he reached this portion of the stream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the native had said, he would see at a distance a
long island, the shape of a finger, extending into
the river. After he had reached and passed this
on the eastern side, he would find himself in a
place more easily navigable for his small craft.</p>

<p>Up this calmer stretch of water Bomba had
been directed to paddle until he should come in
sight of Snake Island, half hidden behind a jutting
point of the mainland.</p>

<p>Bomba had taken it for granted that Ashati and
Neram would accompany him. There was room
for the three of them, and there would be less
danger of capsizing if the canoe were well
weighted down.</p>

<p>But though they helped him willingly to carry
the canoe to the portion of the river where it
would be safe to launch it, they seemed so terrified
when Bomba spoke of his eagerness to reach
Snake Island that the lad stared at them with
amazement.</p>

<p>“You are afraid to go?” he asked.</p>

<p>Poor Ashati and Neram flinched before his accusing
gaze and hung down their heads. For a
long moment there was silence, and then Ashati
answered:</p>

<p>“This Sobrinini is a witch and her island is full
of snakes. If she is a witch, she can make the
snakes do her bidding. Did not the caboclo say
that to go there was to die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Bomba pondered for a while, staring at his companions.
He had not their superstition, but he
could put himself in their places and understand
their feelings.</p>

<p>“You have not the reason to seek out Sobrinini
that I have,” he conceded. “Perhaps that is what
makes me blind to dangers that you see. Bomba
will go alone. You stay here till I get back.”</p>

<p>At this they cast themselves at his feet, crying
out that they would go with him in spite of their
dread of Sobrinini and her island of snakes.</p>

<p>But Bomba would not accept such a sacrifice on
their part, and persisted in setting off alone.</p>

<p>They dropped the canoe into the water, and
almost before Bomba had time to get into it the
current caught the frail bark and sent it dancing
out upon the swirling waters like a feather caught
in the wind.</p>

<p>The jungle boy needed all his skill to keep the
tossing craft on an even keel and set a straight
course down the river. When he could at last
look back, he could see Neram and Ashati standing
on the bank like bronzed statues, looking after
him. He knew that in their hearts they never expected
to see him again.</p>

<p>On he went down the river, the canoe caught
now by one current, now by another, sometimes
dipping to one side at so sharp an angle that it
seemed it must capsize, then righting itself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
dancing on again over the frothing black water—a
frail barrier between Bomba and destruction.</p>

<p>Once the canoe was caught in the iron grip of
a cross-current and rushed at a furious speed
toward the rocks that at that point lined the shore.</p>

<p>Bomba had need of all his strength. Putting
all his force upon the paddle, he grazed the murderous
rocks by the fraction of an inch, and slid
lightly, gently into a stretch of calmer water.</p>

<p>The most dangerous part of his water journey
was now over. All he had to do now was to avoid
the rocks that at places pushed their heads above
the water and the snags formed by parts of the
trunks of trees that had grown on what was dry
ground before the stream had extended its borders
and swallowed them up.</p>

<p>But there were other “snags” too—living snags!
The rough, gnarled bodies of great alligators that
swam or floated lazily about, their backs just
showing above the surface. Many were wholly or
half asleep, others turned red and evil eyes on the
solitary boatman as he sped by. Bomba, remembering
his last experience with the ferocious
brutes, shuddered to think of what would happen
to him if by some evil chance his canoe should be
overturned.</p>

<p>He found the island that was shaped like a
finger, and worked his craft about the further end
of it, heading upstream as the native had directed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>This was more tedious work than his progress
downstream had been, but far less perilous.
Bomba paddled with a will, his heart beating high
with hope as he thought that every stroke was
bringing him nearer to Sobrinini and the secret
whose answer he was so eager to know.</p>

<p>If he shared to some extent the fears that had
taken such strong possession of Ashati and Neram
in regard to Sobrinini and her island of snakes,
his eagerness to learn from the lips of the old
witch woman those facts about his parentage that
had been so long denied him drove all other feelings
from his mind.</p>

<p>But as time passed and still each bend of the
river failed to disclose any island answering to
the description given by the native, Bomba became
anxious and quickened the long, sweeping strokes
of his paddle.</p>

<p>Could the native have deceived him? Was the
fellow chuckling at that very moment at the way
he had deceived the white boy who had waylaid
him?</p>

<p>Bomba hardly thought so. The man had spoken
under the fear of death, if he spoke falsely. He
knew how indefinite was the native idea of distance.
He had heard Casson say in the old days
that when a caboclo said a place was “not far” he
might mean just beyond a bend of the road or
twenty miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Bomba’s first uneasiness came with the lengthening
of the evening shadows. Even if the native
had not misled him and his course was the true
one, Bomba did not relish the idea of approaching
the island in the dark, or even at early dusk.</p>

<p>But even as these thoughts troubled his mind
and the shadows grew deeper, he rounded another
bend of the river and saw before him the object
of his search. He could not be mistaken. The
position and shape of the island were exactly as
the native had described them.</p>

<p>As Bomba, with quickened pulse, drove his
canoe among the heavy rushes that half concealed
the land from anyone upon the river, the sound
of singing came to him.</p>

<p>It was not one of the tribal songs of natives
with which he was familiar.</p>

<p>It was singing such as he had never heard before,
and the voice of the singer was so thin and
eerie and unearthly in that solitary spot that
Bomba felt the hair rise on his scalp.</p>

<p>“Sobrinini!” muttered the lad, and with a
trembling hand parted the bushes from before
his eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>AMID WRITHING SERPENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sight that met Bomba’s eyes was horrible
beyond anything he had ever seen or imagined.</p>

<p>At the extreme end of the island, in mud that
oozed about her ankles, an old withered crone was
performing a weird dance, singing to herself as
she did so in a language that was strange to
Bomba.</p>

<p>But that was not the part of the performance
that held Bomba spellbound, horror-stricken.</p>

<p>It was the snakes, the ropes of slimy, hideous
reptiles that the old woman wound about her
arms, her waist, her neck, even her face, as she
danced faster and ever faster to the strains of her
weird, high-pitched song.</p>

<p>It was then that fear entered into Bomba, a
fear such as had never been felt by him when he
battled with the wild beasts of the jungle. Then
he had fought with things of flesh and blood, with
something he could understand. But what he saw
now seemed to be tinctured by the supernatural.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
His flesh crawled. The scene was revolting and
horrible beyond description.</p>

<p>This must be Sobrinini, this hag that played with
and fondled and petted these hissing reptiles that
wound their coils about her body. She must be a
witch, as the native had claimed. How otherwise
could she do a thing like this and remain unharmed?</p>

<p>And if she was a witch—and to Bomba’s primitive,
half-taught mind this did not seem at all
impossible—she might have it within her power
to lay a spell upon him, if she wished. Perhaps
she might turn him into one of those very snakes
that hissed and writhed about her.</p>

<p>At the thought, Bomba was tempted to flee
from the spot. But something in him, stronger
even than his fear, drew him resistlessly toward
that weird figure on the river bank.</p>

<p>He worked the canoe in as far toward the
island as he dared and wedged it tightly among
the rushes, trusting that they would hold it for
him until he returned.</p>

<p>He found that the water was shallow, and silently
slipped into it and waded toward the bank.
Dread of the piranhas, a dangerous, sharp-toothed
fish, such as infest all the waters of the
jungle, hurried Bomba’s steps so that he was not
as cautious in his approach to Sobrinini as he
would otherwise have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Although he made for the shore at some distance
from the old woman, so that he might
choose his own time for drawing near her after
she had finished with the demon-like dance, he
slipped, when he tried for a footing in the slimy
ooze of the river bank, and came down with a
heavy splash.</p>

<p>The sound startled Sobrinini. The weird
song died on her withered lips and she stood
staring. The tropic night had fallen now, but a
full moon had risen, and by the light of it Bomba
could be seen as he got to his feet and gained the
bank.</p>

<p>At sight of him, a shrill yell pealed from the
lips of the old woman, which brought dark figures
running to her from all directions. Bomba saw
one rise up in front of him as though conjured
from the earth by magic. He turned to avoid the
outstretched arms of this apparition, did not see
the hole that yawned at his feet, and fell into
a nest of writhing snakes.</p>

<p>He was so paralyzed with horror that he could
not move. Perhaps it was to that that he owed
his life. For as the snakes, most of which had
been dozing in the slimy ooze at the bottom of the
pit, recovered from their surprise and coiled to
attack, Sobrinini pushed through the crowd at the
edge of the hole and began to sing.</p>

<p>It was a lilting, rhythmic tune, and at the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
notes of it the hideous reptiles surrounding Bomba
began to sway to the sound and one after another
slipped over the edge of the pit and slithered away
into the darkness.</p>

<p>Bomba climbed out, with the gray mud plastered
over him. Still shaken at the narrowness of his
escape from a terrible death, the lad drew himself
up beside Sobrinini.</p>

<p>The ring of natives, male and female, closed in
upon Bomba and the old witch woman as the
sound died on the lips of Sobrinini. Several of
the group carried flaring torches, and by this
flickering light the scene seemed as unreal and
fantastic as a dream.</p>

<p>As Sobrinini saw Bomba before her, she turned
upon him with a look so fierce and malignant that
the lad involuntarily drew away from her.</p>

<p>“You scared my snakes!” she cried accusingly.
“For that you should be burned by fire and flung
into the river for the alligators to feast on your
flesh. It was for their sakes, not yours, that I
saved your life, wicked one. My snakes must not
be frightened, my little pets—ha, ha, ha!” and she
went off into such a fit of horrible merriment that
Bomba’s heart froze within him.</p>

<p>If at that moment he could have reached his
canoe by any means and left that fearful place
behind him forever, he might have yielded to the
temptation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>But it was too late now. The ring of natives
surrounded him, and even if he succeeded by a bold
dash in forcing his way through them, there was
little chance of escape. They would reach him
and drag him back before he could get the canoe
clear of the bushes and head for the open stream.</p>

<p>The impulse to flee lasted but a moment. The
next, Bomba pulled himself together and was his
cool, courageous self once more.</p>

<p>Sobrinini had worked herself into a frenzy of
fury. She danced about Bomba in a hideous way,
shaking her shriveled fists in the air and mouthing
horribly.</p>

<p>Now she came close to the lad and pushed her
wrinkled face in his. She raised an arm above
her head as though to strike him. Bomba stood
unflinching.</p>

<p>She paused suddenly, arrested apparently by
something she saw in his face.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she cried. “Bring the torches nearer.”</p>

<p>The command rang out in a strikingly clear
voice and instantly there was a stir among the
natives. Evidently she was accustomed to being
obeyed without question.</p>

<p>One great sullen fellow came forward and
thrust his flaring torch almost in Bomba’s face.</p>

<p>Sobrinini peered closely at the lad for a moment,
and then shrank back with a piercing scream.</p>

<p>“You!” she cried, again coming close and staring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
at him wildly. “How came you here? Are
you a ghost, Bartow?”</p>

<p>Into Bomba’s heart came a swift feeling of
amazement.</p>

<p>What was the meaning of this? Like an echo
of the words came the memory of Jojasta’s cry
as Bomba had bent above him when he was pinned
beneath the fallen column. Jojasta had called
him Bartow and thought he was a ghost.</p>

<p>He took a step toward Sobrinini, who was
still staring at him fearfully.</p>

<p>“What mean you?” he cried.</p>

<p>Seeing the terror into which their priestess had
been thrown, a strange wild singing rose from the
native women as they wove in and out in fantastic
mazes, evidently designed to ward off the evil
portent.</p>

<p>The bony fingers of Sobrinini closed on Bomba’s
arm. Her voice was shrill and urgent, as she
said in his ear:</p>

<p>“Come with me, Bartow. Ghost or not, come
with Sobrinini.”</p>

<p>As in a nightmare, his mind in a tumult of conflicting
emotions, Bomba allowed himself to be led
away.</p>

<p>They passed through dank, long grass that
sprang from the marshy ground, and in some
places grew as high as Bomba’s head. Once he
felt the slimy body of a snake beneath his foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and leaped aside, only to feel his foot brush another.</p>

<p>“Be not afraid of the snakes. They are my
pets and will not harm anyone that is with Sobrinini,”
crooned the old crone at his side.</p>

<p>She knew her way well, for she moved along
the winding trail without ever looking down, keeping
her fascinated gaze on Bomba’s face.</p>

<p>Twice Bomba started to ask her what she meant
by calling him Bartow and a ghost, but twice he
was halted by a bony, shriveled finger on his lips
and a croaking cry:</p>

<p>“Hush! Speak not, Bartow, or you will break
the spell and shatter it into a thousand tinkling
fragments.”</p>

<p>She went on, muttering to herself, until at last
they came to a large wooden building. A flickering
light from its gaping windows threw grotesque
shadows upon the ground.</p>

<p>Bomba felt a dread of entering the place. Like
the wild things of the jungle, he felt safer in the
open. But Sobrinini’s hand was upon his arm,
and she dragged him through the doorway. Her
manner grew ever more feverish and wild. She
seemed possessed by a terrible excitement. Bomba
did not venture to dispute her will.</p>

<p>He found himself in a strange place, the like of
which he had never seen before. Tearing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
glance from the withered mask that was the face
of Sobrinini, he looked about him.</p>

<p>Torches flickered and flared in crude receptacles
fastened to the walls and lighted up the bare
and desolate room.</p>

<p>Rows of crude chairs stood upon the uneven
wooden floor, and above these, halfway to the
patched and leaking roof, a tiny balcony had been
constructed. At either end of this was a small
compartment with rounded front, meant to represent
an opera box, though this of course Bomba
could not know.</p>

<p>At the extreme front of the big room was a
raised platform, meant to serve as a stage of this
dismal imitation of an opera house.</p>

<p>As Bomba gazed about him, surprised and bewildered,
Sobrinini left his side, and with a horrid
simulation of youth skipped to the platform.</p>

<p>Then she turned and made him a low bow, a
hideous smirk cracking the wrinkles of her withered
face.</p>

<p>“Come closer, Bartow. Come closer, dear
Bartow! Do!” she urged, in a voice at first
soft and coaxing, but that ended in a shrill cackle.
“I will give you a good seat, Bartow—the best
seat in the house—in the first row center. You
can hear me better there than from a box. Come!”
she cried, as he hesitated, her simpering giving
place to a terrible frown. “Why do you stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
there blinking at me like a fool? Do not rouse
my wrath, Bartow! The wrath of Sobrinini is a
terrible thing, as no one should know better than
you.”</p>

<p>Bomba came forward quickly, alarmed by the
swift change in the old crone’s manner. But she
simpered and smirked again when he approached,
and, skipping lightly from the platform, forced
him with a playfulness that Bomba found scarcely
less terrifying than her wrath into one of the crazy
chairs close to the stage.</p>

<p>“Now I will sing to you!” she cried, and sprang
up again upon the platform.</p>

<p>Bomba watched with a strange fascination
while the old woman danced and sang in a strange
language unknown to him. The lilting songs, even
when sung by that cracked and ruined voice, struck
a responsive chord in the boy and filled him with
emotions that he could neither analyze nor understand.</p>

<p>He did not know that that voice, when in its
prime, had thrilled great audiences that included
emperors and kings and had given the singer a
reputation as wide as the civilized world.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sobrinini paused, and fixing Bomba
with a strange intent gaze, sang in a voice that had
magically lost most of its raucous quality and for
the moment had become the faint, sad echo of
something that had been supremely beautiful—sang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> 
a tender, haunting melody that touched some
almost forgotten memory in Bomba’s heart and
filled him with an exquisite pain.</p>

<p>Somewhere, long since, he had heard that melody!
But when and where?</p>

<p>Slowly the music drew him step by step toward
that fantastic figure on the stage.</p>

<p>“Tell me!” he cried imploringly. “Tell me,
Sobrinini, was that my mother’s song?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an instant the fierce, bright eyes of the
old hag softened. Her bony fingers hovered over
Bomba’s hair, as though they would have stroked
it.</p>

<p>Then she threw back her head and laughed, a
harsh, cackling laugh that caused Bomba to
wince and shrink back as from the sharp thrust of
a knife.</p>

<p>“Eh, Bartow, you would have a joke with Sobrinini,
my fine one,” croaked the old crone, wagging
her finger in Bomba’s face and leering at him
in a way she meant to be facetious. “No, no,
Bartow—or Bartow’s ghost—that was not your
mother’s song, but the song of your wife——”</p>

<p>“My wife!” the words broke from Bomba impetuously.
“What mean you, Sobrinini?”</p>

<p>“Ah, you would still have your joke with
Sobrinini, eh?” The old woman leaned forward
again and tapped him on the arm with her skinny
finger. “But you cannot forget that song, Bartow,
the song your wife sang after Bonny was born.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>But when Bomba would have questioned her
further, she pushed him away from her and began
to sing again.</p>

<p>“La la la! la la la!” she sang.</p>

<p>It was the gay and vibrant melody that poor
Casson had tried to sing.</p>

<p>Bomba could do nothing but stand in bewildered
silence and watch the old woman as she danced
and sang, whirling about the poor stage with a
nimbleness that was amazing in one of her age.</p>

<p>Confusedly, he tried to think of the things she
had said to him, but beneath the wild spell of that
performance he could reason nothing out, and
could only stare dazedly at this wreck of what had
once been a great genius.</p>

<p>What would happen to him, Bomba wondered,
when the woman tired of dancing and perhaps
found out that he was not Bartow or Bartow’s
ghost as she thought him then, but only Bomba,
a boy of the jungle.</p>

<p>With one last twirl and a deep bow to an imaginary
audience, Sobrinini brought her weird performance
to an end. She grinned toothlessly at
the staring boy, and skipped lightly to the edge of
the platform.</p>

<p>“Ha, Bartow, like you Sobrinini in the dance
that charmed all Paris?” she chirped, patting
Bomba’s shoulder coquettishly. “Sobrinini has
not lost her art. How say you, Bartow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Bomba felt that he must keep her in good
humor with him if he were to gain that information
about himself for which he had risked so
much. He had already learned something—or
guessed something. Perhaps he could learn more.</p>

<p>“I like your dance,” he told her gravely. “But
I like best the song that Bartow’s wife sang when—when——”</p>

<p>“When Bonny was born?” prompted the old
woman, and without waiting for a reply began to
hum again that tender melody that had found its
way to the depths of Bomba’s heart.</p>

<p>It thrilled the boy again more strangely than
before. When the song was done, emotion conquered
Bomba’s caution, and he flung out his hands
to Sobrinini, begging her to tell him what she
knew about Bartow, about Bartow’s wife, about
the child that she had called Bonny.</p>

<p>But Sobrinini drew back from him, quick suspicion
glinting in her eyes.</p>

<p>“No, no! Not now, Bartow, not now! It is
another joke that you play on Sobrinini. No, no!
To-night you will sleep here and to-morrow I
will pay back your jokes with some of my own.
Come! I will show you where you are to sleep.”</p>

<p>So saying, and mumbling to herself as she had
before, the demented woman led him out of the
strange room with the chairs and platform that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
had so bewildered the boy and down a long,
dark passage.</p>

<p>There Sobrinini paused and clapped her hands
sharply.</p>

<p>As though by magic, a figure appeared out of
the darkness before them.</p>

<p>“A torch!” croaked Sobrinini. “A torch to
drive the shadows back into the night. Bring a
torch. Make haste.”</p>

<p>The figure disappeared and in a few seconds
returned with a light. The features of the slave
seemed savage and sinister in the flickering illumination.</p>

<p>“Give it to me! Give it to me!” cried Sobrinini
irritably. “Now, slave, begone!”</p>

<p>Instantly the figure vanished again, and Bomba
looked about him apprehensively. For a moment
he had the fantastic notion that the shadows all
about him were filled with ghostly figures that appeared
and disappeared by magic and made no
noise.</p>

<p>But Sobrinini stalked before him, flaring torch
in hand. Bomba followed her into a room so
small that the farthest corners were made bright
by the wavering light of the torch.</p>

<p>As Bomba entered the place he had a strange
feeling that he had seen it before, had been in it
before, had once looked about him as he was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
looking at the few articles of furniture and the
pictures on the walls.</p>

<p>But even while he felt this so strongly that it
seemed almost uncanny, Bomba knew that it could
not be so and that it was impossible he had ever
enacted this scene or anything like it before.</p>

<p>In all his wild life in the jungle, he had never
seen anything like that strange object in one corner
of the room, raised from the floor by posts and
covered with a cloth. If Bomba had been told
that the strange object was a bed, he would have
been no better informed than before. As far as he
could remember, he had never slept in anything
like that in his life.</p>

<p>While he was taking in the various features of
the room, Sobrinini deposited the torch in a socket
on the wall and turned again to Bomba.</p>

<p>“Bartow,” she said, and there was that softened
light in her wild eyes that had appeared there
while she was singing the tender lullaby that
Bartow’s wife had crooned to Bonny, “this is
where you sleep while you remain with Sobrinini
on her island. Good-night, Bartow, or Bartow’s
ghost, and pleasant dreams!”</p>

<p>Then she turned and, noiselessly as a ghost or a
shadow, glided from the room.</p>

<p>Bomba stood where she had left him, motionless.</p>

<p>What was that strange feeling that made his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
heart swell within him until he could not bear the
pain of it, that made him reach out wildly, beseechingly,
for some vague, beautiful thing that he
had never known, or only dimly remembered?</p>

<p>What was it that suddenly made him feel his
loneliness and desolation more keenly than he had
ever felt it in his life, as though he had been given
for a moment a glimpse of something warm and
friendly and sweet, only to have the curtain fall
again and leave him in his solitude, more utterly
alone than he had ever been before?</p>

<p>What was it that drew him haltingly, almost
fearfully, across the tiny room to stop beneath a
picture on the wall and, with his hungry eyes upraised,
stare at it intently?</p>

<p>Bomba could not tell. He only knew that
within him there was a growing tumult of emotions,
fear, hope, doubt, and a longing so fierce
that it was pain.</p>

<p>Into the jungle lad’s upturned, pleading face the
beautiful eyes in the picture looked steadily and
gravely down. It was a lovely face, girlish and
sweet, with soft hair waved back from a broad,
low forehead and with eyes one knew were soft
and dark. The lips turned up at the corners, half-smiling.</p>

<p>Bomba had never seen that beautiful pictured
face before, as far as he could remember. Then
how was it that those great eyes looking into his,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
those sweet lips parted as though to speak to him,
touched a chord in him that had never before resounded,
and increased a thousandfold his longing
for that vague and beautiful thing that he had
never known?</p>

<p>She was even fairer than the woman with the
golden hair. Yes, much more fair and sweet.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bomba’s eyes were full of tears, and
he heard himself crying in a voice that shook:</p>

<p>“Mother! Mother!”</p>

<p>With both hands upraised toward the beautiful
face, Bomba slid slowly to the floor and lay there,
his frame shaking with unaccustomed sobs.</p>

<p>Softly, weirdly, tenderly, there floated to the
lad, as though from a great distance, the strain
of that sweet melody, the song that Bartow’s wife
had sung to Bonny.</p>

<p>Long after the lullaby had died away Bomba
remained there, motionless, crouched beneath the
picture, one arm before his eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>A STARTLING INTERRUPTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Worn</span> out by the exciting adventures and fierce
emotions of the day, Bomba fell asleep. When he
awoke the chill gray of early dawn was stealing in
at the window of the little room.</p>

<p>He was still on the floor beneath the picture.
But he would not have sought the bed in any event.
It represented to him something so strange that he
would probably have been unable to sleep in it.
The hard floor on which he now lay or the earth
of the jungle or his own hammock was far more
restful and sleep compelling.</p>

<p>At first, only half awake, Bomba had difficulty
in remembering the events of the day before and
why he was in the place where he found himself.
He sprang to his feet, rubbed his eyes, and looked
about him.</p>

<p>His eyes fell upon the picture of the beautiful
lady, and memory returned to him.</p>

<p>That tender, sweet melody sung by Sobrinini!
Bomba had never heard it till lately, as far as he
could remember, and yet felt that he had known it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
always. He wondered at the power it had exercised
over him. It had tugged at his heart as
though it would pull it out by the roots.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he thought, this was the work of Sobrinini.
Was she not a witch? Certainly, everything
he had witnessed since his arrival at the
island tended to that conclusion. The mortal fear
in which her servitors stood of her would seem to
indicate the possession of some supernatural
power. Had she woven a spell about him, made
him seem to remember things that had never
happened?</p>

<p>Yet this spell, if spell it was, had not been a
malignant one. It had made him strangely happy.
The tears that had been forced from him were
tears of joy in the main, and even the melancholy
that attended them had been tender and sweet.</p>

<p>And this emotion had been so rare in the boy’s
lonely life that it brought a rush of gratitude
toward Sobrinini. He was not afraid of the
weaver of spells and the charmer of serpents. He
stood in awe of her, but the predominant feeling
was of friendship and pity for her demented condition.</p>

<p>And there was something else that made a tie
between them. She had known Bartow and Bartow’s
wife and Bonny. How much that name
sounded like Bomba!</p>

<p>In the dim light of the growing dawn, Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
came close to the beautiful pictured face on the
wall and studied it wistfully. He could see love
in those eyes as they looked at him. He would
ask Sobrinini for that picture. Perhaps she would
give it to him.</p>

<p>He dwelt on it, until every feature was engraved
on his memory. From that time on, he would
always be able to see that face, even when his eyes
were closed.</p>

<p>Reluctantly at last he turned away. He had
work to do, and time was pressing. He must find
out from Sobrinini what he had come to learn.
And then he must hurry on in pursuit of the captives
of Nascanora. He must be at hand when the
party passed the point in the river where Ashati
and Neram were still waiting for him.</p>

<p>He would seek out Sobrinini at once and demand
from her an answer to the questions that tormented
him. He would find out who Bartow was
and why he, Bomba, had twice been taken for
Bartow or Bartow’s ghost.</p>

<p>With these thoughts in mind and forgetful of
the fact that he had had nothing to eat since the
afternoon of the day before, Bomba strode into
the passage and found his way back to the strange
room with the chairs and platform where Sobrinini
had sung to him.</p>

<p>The place looked changed to him now. It was
not so weird nor mysterious now that the torches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
had flickered out and dawn had replaced the
shadows of the night.</p>

<p>If Bomba had expected to find Sobrinini there,
he was disappointed. The great bare hall was
deserted, and though he stopped and listened intently,
there was no sign of life anywhere.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there came to him from a distance
the sound of singing. First Sobrinini’s voice—he
could not be mistaken in it now—then other
voices joining in a sort of weird chant that chilled
the lad’s blood yet drew him irresistibly toward the
point from which the sound was coming.</p>

<p>Slowly he emerged from the building and found
himself enveloped in a swirling, gray mist.</p>

<p>Yet the sound of the chant served him as a
guide, and he went on and on, now coming closer
to the singers, then seeming to draw away from
them as the voices receded.</p>

<p>At last, when he was beginning to think that
Sobrinini had again laid a spell on him and that
the voices were ghostly voices, to be heard by none
but himself, he saw a dark form emerge from the
mist and after it another and another.</p>

<p>Bomba stood still and watched. The natives
were dancing, flinging their arms about wildly and
intoning their weird chant, now harsh and loud,
now soft like the sighing of the wind through the
trees.</p>

<p>It was like a dance of ghosts, and it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
alone the chill damp of the air that struck cold to
Bomba’s heart. He felt as though he were in some
other world, and that an evil one. He had never
longed for the warmth and brightness of the
jungle sun as he did at that moment.</p>

<p>But as the natives danced on, as tireless apparently
as the ghosts that Bomba half-thought
them, the mist began to clear and the sun struck
through, causing the moisture upon the dark bodies
of the dancers to glisten.</p>

<p>Then, in the center of the ring, Bomba beheld
Sobrinini, whirling wildly in a mad dance, long,
gray locks streaming about her, and in each upflung
hand the head of a great snake, while the bodies
of the reptiles coiled about her arms and neck.</p>

<p>Bomba felt a sick faintness come upon him as
he watched with repulsion the loathsome sight.
He stepped back a pace or two with an impulse
to shut the scene away from him. But at that
moment Sobrinini beheld him and called to him.</p>

<p>She halted in her dance, and the snakes, uncoiling
themselves from about her arms and neck, as
though they knew that their part in the frenzied
performance was over, slithered off quietly into the
long marsh grass and sought their lairs.</p>

<p>Sobrinini darted through the ring of breathless
natives, and before Bomba had guessed her purpose
threw her skinny arms about the boy’s neck.</p>

<p>“Bartow! My Bartow!” she cried, in a loud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
cracked voice. “Come and dance with Sobrinini.
Come!”</p>

<p>But Bomba drew back, striving to disengage
himself from the clinging arms of the witch
woman. If one of her own loathsome snakes
had coiled about his neck, he could hardly have
felt a greater repulsion.</p>

<p>“Come! Come, dance with Sobrinini,” the
woman said in a wheedling voice, as she untwined
her shriveled arms to grasp him by the hand. “I
will call back my snakes, and you shall fondle
them to show you that they will not fill your veins
with poison or crush your bones when Sobrinini is
nigh. Come! Why do you draw back? What
are you waiting for, Bartow?”</p>

<p>“But I am not Bartow,” blurted out Bomba in
his desperation to be rid of her and learn the truth
about himself. “Jojasta, the medicine man of the
Moving Mountain, called me Bartow also. But I
am not he. I am Bomba! Bomba, the jungle boy!”</p>

<p>Sobrinini paused, a look of bewilderment overspreading
her sharp features.</p>

<p>“Not Bartow? Not Bartow?” she mumbled,
coming close to peer into the lad’s face. “No, no,
not Bartow, surely. But then you are Bartow’s
ghost.”</p>

<p>“I am no ghost!” cried Bomba. “Bones are in
my body. Blood runs through my veins. See—if
you prick my flesh, it bleeds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>In his eagerness to prove to the old crone that
he was human and no ghostly visitor, Bomba drew
forth his machete and thrust the sharp point of it
into his brown, sinewy forearm. Blood welled up
from the slight cut, red, pulsing blood.</p>

<p>“See—I am no ghost!” cried the lad again.
“Ghosts do not have blood. Ghosts do not have
bones. One can walk through ghosts as one walks
through the mists of the early morning. Let anyone
try to walk through me, Bomba, the jungle
boy!”</p>

<p>The natives had stopped dancing and singing
their wild invocation to the dawn. Now they
stood in a half circle about Sobrinini and Bomba,
looking on curiously.</p>

<p>At Bomba’s challenge, not one of them stirred.
He looked exceedingly dangerous, standing in
all his splendid strength with the sunlight glinting
on the red point of his upraised machete. It
would not be well to try to walk through him.</p>

<p>The puzzled expression had deepened upon the
face of Sobrinini. She stood regarding Bomba
with bewilderment and a dawning suspicion.</p>

<p>“Then if you are not Bartow and no ghost,”
she demanded, “who are you?”</p>

<p>And suddenly all the lad’s long groping for the
truth, his passionate eagerness to learn the facts
concerning his parents, the many disappointments
he had suffered and the realization of his desperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
loneliness rushed over him in an overwhelming
flood, and filled him with emotion that found vent
in a headlong torrent of words.</p>

<p>“Who am I? If I could give you the answer
to that question, Sobrinini, I would not be here.
I know nothing about myself except that I am
Bomba, a boy of the jungle, and have spent
my life with Cody Casson on the edge of the
swamp. Casson could not tell me who I am nor
who my father and my mother were. He sent me
to Jojasta, and Jojasta before he died said,
‘Go to Sobrinini, she will tell you!’ I have come,
Sobrinini.”</p>

<p>He took a step toward her, hands outstretched.</p>

<p>At that instant there was a wild yell, and a
native, panting, the sweat streaming from him,
dashed toward them and flung himself at the feet
of Sobrinini.</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit of the Jungle save us!”
cried the frightened wretch, trembling as with the
ague. “The headhunters have come! The great
chief, Nascanora, is at hand!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>IN THE HANDS OF THE HEADHUNTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a chorus of frightened exclamations
and a wild scattering of the natives that showed
the dread that Nascanora’s name inspired in all
the people of that region.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, Sobrinini and Bomba found
themselves alone.</p>

<p>The old woman herself had grown ashen. She
grasped Bomba by the hand.</p>

<p>“Come!” she said. “I will hide you. Quick!”</p>

<p>But even as she spoke there was a wild yell
from the forest, and a horde of savages, headed
by Nascanora himself, burst into the clearing.</p>

<p>Bomba had drawn his knife, determined to sell
his life dearly. Seeing his threatening attitude,
the savages were rushing on him with spears held
high when a command from Nascanora halted
them.</p>

<p>“Do not kill him—now,” he commanded.
“That would be too easy. His death, when it
comes, must be hard and long. And after that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
his head shall stand on the wigwam to show how
Nascanora deals with his enemies.”</p>

<p>Sobrinini stepped forward, her eyes glaring.</p>

<p>“Beware what you do, Nascanora,” she warned.
“Leave this boy alone and go your way lest I put
my spell upon you. It is not well to make Sobrinini
angry.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of uneasiness among the
savages, for the fame of Sobrinini as a witch had
gone far and wide. That Nascanora himself was
not wholly unmoved was evident from the way he
evaded the blazing eyes of the old woman.</p>

<p>But he was made of sterner stuff than his followers,
and he had come too far to be balked of
his prey.</p>

<p>“I would have no quarrel with Sobrinini,” he
said placatingly. “I do not wish to hurt her or
her people. But the boy must go with me. Else
I will kill all the people on this island and take
their heads along for the women of my tribe to
rejoice over. Nascanora has spoken!”</p>

<p>Before Sobrinini could speak, Bomba intervened.
To fight against such odds was hopeless.
Flight was equally impossible. He must submit
to capture, and trust to his quick wit and courage
to escape later.</p>

<p>“Listen, Sobrinini!” he said. “They are many,
and I do not wish that your people should die. I
will go with Nascanora. But first,” he added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
turning to the chief, whose eyes were glowing with
a baleful glare of triumph, “I would ask Nascanora
a question.”</p>

<p>“Speak!” said the chief.</p>

<p>“Nascanora is a great chief,” said Bomba. “He
is not afraid of anyone. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“It is so,” replied Nascanora, rather astonished
at the tribute, but swelling with pride.</p>

<p>“Then will Nascanora fight Bomba alone?”
asked the lad. “Fight him with knives?”</p>

<p>If a bomb had been thrown into the midst of
the savages it would not have created greater
surprise. They looked at each other in amazement.
Was the boy mad?</p>

<p>The most astounded of all was Nascanora himself.
He could not believe his ears. To be
bearded thus, he, Nascanora, in the presence of
his braves and by a boy! His eyes glowed with
fury and his face grew dark with menace.</p>

<p>“Such idle words will make your death still
harder,” he threatened. “It is not well to mock
Nascanora.”</p>

<p>“I do not mock,” returned Bomba quietly. “I
would make a compact with Nascanora. I will
fight him with knives. We can throw the knives
or fight hand to hand, as Nascanora chooses. But
Nascanora must swear by his gods and command
his braves that, if he is killed, the captives shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
go free. It is for their freedom that I will fight
Nascanora. Surely he is not afraid.”</p>

<p>Lithe, supple, muscular, his head held high as he
flung out the concluding taunt, Bomba gazed full
into the glowering eyes of the chief. He hoped
that Nascanora would be goaded into accepting the
challenge. The boy was a master of the machete,
either thrust or thrown. If he should conquer, as
he felt sure he would, his victory at one stroke
would free the captives. If he should lose—well,
that was in the hands of fate.</p>

<p>Nascanora’s face was a study. It was working
with rage that did not hide, however, a shade of
apprehension. He had tested the boy’s courage
on one previous occasion, and had learned to respect
it. He towered over his captive in size, but
he doubted whether he exceeded him in strength.
And he doubted very much whether he equaled
him in skill and agility.</p>

<p>The chief was in a quandary. He knew that
his braves were looking on and wondering at his
hesitation. On the other hand, life was dear to
him.</p>

<p>He glared at Bomba. The lad looked unflinchingly
at him. And in the duel of eyes, Nascanora’s
were the first to fall.</p>

<p>“It is not for a great chief like Nascanora to
fight with a boy,” he blustered, seeking to cover
his defeat. “He shall learn what happens to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
them who speak boastful words to Nascanora.
Bind his hands and we will go.”</p>

<p>The command was quickly obeyed. Sobrinini
again attempted to interpose, but Bomba checked
her.</p>

<p>“Sobrinini is good,” he said, “but there is no
reason why she and her people should be killed.
Bomba will go, but he will come back again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she whispered agitatedly. “You
will come back. You are brave. You made Nascanora’s
heart turn to water. Sobrinini can see
into the future. You will come back, and then I
will tell you what you want to know.”</p>

<p>Bomba would have urged her to tell him then,
but he was roughly hurried away, leaving Sobrinini
to wring her withered hands and mutter invocations
to her gods.</p>

<p>Despite his dangerous plight, Bomba found himself
in a strangely buoyant frame of mind. He
still felt the exaltation that came from his triumph
over Nascanora. He had shamed him in the eyes
of his braves. Perhaps that would weaken his
prestige with them and make ultimate escape
easier.</p>

<p>He was not oblivious, of course, to the fact that
his defiance had made Nascanora a more bitter
enemy than ever. He watched the angry figure
striding along at the head of his braves. Doubtless
at this moment the chief was thinking of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
fiendish mode of torture with which to slake his
thirst for revenge.</p>

<p>Before long they reached the part of the island
where Nascanora had disembarked. Here two
great war canoes were drawn up. Bomba was
pushed into one of them, then the natives got
in. With a few swift thrusts of the paddle the
canoes were sent into the center of the stream.
Then they headed their course for the mainland.</p>

<p>The savages were familiar with the rapids, and,
evading the pitfalls of the river, rapidly neared
the other shore.</p>

<p>As they drew closer, Bomba saw the rest of
Nascanora’s band camped close to the shore. In
the ring they formed he could see a group of dejected
figures, evidently the captives.</p>

<p>The canoes touched the bank. Bomba was
pulled out by a couple of braves and thrust into
the crowd of prisoners. His eyes flew from face
to face.</p>

<p>They rested on the frail, tired visage of an old
man who rose and tottered toward him.</p>

<p>“Casson!” cried Bomba.</p>

<p>“Bomba!” exclaimed Casson pantingly as he
threw his arms about the boy’s shoulders.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>THE GIANT CATARACT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old man sobbed as he hugged the lad to
his breast.</p>

<p>Bomba’s joy at the reunion was no less, though
his bound hands prevented him from returning the
embrace.</p>

<p>When at last they stood apart and looked fondly
at each other, Bomba was grieved to the heart to
see the ravages that the hardships and miseries of
the journey had made in the face and frame of
the old naturalist. The first was so thin as to be
almost transparent, and the latter had wasted to
a shadow.</p>

<p>But he was still alive. Bomba had not come too
late to see him once more in the flesh. He would
still have a chance of rescuing him and taking him
back to the old cabin where he could end his
days in peace. But the boy’s heart sank as he
looked at the bonds on his own wrists and realized
how slight his chances were to rescue anybody
while he was a captive himself.</p>

<p>When their first emotion had somewhat subsided,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Bomba had time to look about for the others
that he knew. Many faces were strange to him,
and it was evident that, from the headhunters’
point of view, their foray had been crowned with
great success. They were carrying back an unusually
large number of prisoners, some to be
tortured and killed, others to drag out a lifetime
of misery.</p>

<p>Bomba’s eyes lighted on Pipina, who came forward
eagerly and threw her arms about his neck
with an outburst of tears and broken ejaculations.
Also, there was Hondura, the Araos chief, who
greeted him merely with a grunt and the habitual
stolidity of his race.</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell upon Pirah, the young daughter
of Hondura, who, herself unbound, came running
toward him with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>She clasped Bomba’s hands fondly, noting sorrowfully
that they were bound, and snuggled close
up to him, smiling in his face. He reached down,
and as she drew near, rubbed her cheek with his.</p>

<p>“Is Bomba glad to see Pirah?” she asked almost
happily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the boy, forbearing to add
that he would far rather never have seen her at
all than to see her in such a position. “Pirah
saved Bomba’s life when he came to the village
of the Araos, and Bomba will never forget.”</p>

<p>“But no, Bomba, you must not be glad. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
captives,” and the child’s bright face clouded.
“We go as slaves. You may not teach me, as you
did before, to shoot the bow and arrow. Do you
remember when you came to our village that you
showed me how to use your bow? But now—oh,
what is to become of you, of me?”</p>

<p>Every word the little girl uttered stabbed
Bomba to the heart. She had saved his life once.
She was his friend, and he had all too few friends.
He shuddered to think of what might be the fate
of this innocent child in the hands of the savage
headhunters.</p>

<p>Their captors were preparing to break camp
and were so busy with their packing that for the
time the prisoners were left to themselves. That
gave Bomba his chance to get together with Casson,
Hondura and Pipina, and exchange experiences.</p>

<p>He learned, to his relief, that they had not been
treated as harshly as he had feared. Their captors
had kept them fairly well fed. But they had
told them frankly and gleefully why they did this.
They wanted them to be strong enough to endure
for a long time the tortures that would be meted
out to them at the great festival that would attend
the entry of the triumphant warriors into their
village.</p>

<p>But however fiendish might be the motive, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
fact remained that the prisoners were fairly strong
and well. Bomba was glad of this, as it would
facilitate matters if a chance offered to make a
break for liberty.</p>

<p>He told them in detail of his own adventures,
not neglecting the way he had shamed Nascanora,
at which they laughed gleefully. And he brought
new courage to them by telling them that the
Araos, with all the strength they could muster
from other tribes, were following on their trail.
At any time now they might appear in sight and
deliver them.</p>

<p>While he was talking he looked up and saw two
figures approaching him. They were downcast
and abject and held their faces so low on their
breasts that at first he did not recognize them.
But as they drew nearer, he saw that they were
Ashati and Neram.</p>

<p>“You here, too?” he said, as they squatted down
beside him.</p>

<p>“Yes, master,” Ashati answered for both, while
Neram nodded his head despondently.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said Bomba. “How did it come
that you fell into the hands of Nascanora?”</p>

<p>“We were waiting for you near the bank of the
river,” replied Ashati, “when we heard the march
of feet. We hid in the jungle, hoping that the
enemy would go past and not see us. But they
had with them the man you caught and who told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
you the way to go to the island of Sobrinini. He
led them to the place where you met him, and they
beat the bushes till they found us.”</p>

<p>“And that man told Nascanora that I had gone
to the island, and that is why they came there for
me!” exclaimed Bomba.</p>

<p>“We should have killed the man while we had
him on the ground,” stated Neram.</p>

<p>“No,” said Bomba. “But it would have been
well to have bound him and left him with you
until after Nascanora had passed by. Yet the
man swore by his gods that he would not tell.”</p>

<p>“Nascanora has ways of making men speak,”
put in Ashati significantly.</p>

<p>“His heart is as black as Jojasta’s was,” declared
Neram, as though that summed up the
total of human depravity. “He will torture us
with fire and steel and then place our heads on the
wigwams of his people.”</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” said Bomba. “Sobrinini
told me that I would get away from him. And
Bomba will not leave his friends Ashati and
Neram behind.”</p>

<p>The news helped to dissipate the gloom on the
countenances of the slaves.</p>

<p>“If Sobrinini said so, it must be true!” exclaimed
Ashati, “for she is a witch.”</p>

<p>“The greatest in all the jungle,” confirmed
Neram. “She is very wise. Her snakes whisper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
in her ears and tell her what will be in the days
to come.”</p>

<p>They turned away much cheered and comforted,
and just then their captors gave the signal for the
march.</p>

<p>The prisoners were herded roughly together in
the center of the marching columns, so that there
could be no possible chance to escape. Fortunately,
they had had a long rest while the war
party under Nascanora had been making the raid
on Snake Island, so they were in fairly good condition
for the journey, and that the journey would
not be a long one was now evident from the thunderous
sound that grew ever louder and louder in
their ears. They were approaching the Giant
Cataract, where dwelt Nascanora and his people.</p>

<p>To the hapless prisoners, that sound was like
the knell of doom.</p>

<p>The thunderous sound increased in volume, and
suddenly at a turn in the trail, the most magnificent
sight that Bomba had ever seen burst upon them.</p>

<p>They had reached the Giant Cataract!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>RUSPAK GLOATS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> a great bluff, hundreds of feet in height,
a huge torrent of water poured down into a gorge
beneath and rose again in an ocean of spray. The
sound was deafening. The mass of waters
gleamed with all the colors of the rainbow. It
was almost beyond the imagination of a dreamer.</p>

<p>It made Bomba catch his breath and stand entranced.
For a few minutes he forgot that he was
a prisoner, forgot the horrors that might await
him. His soul drank in the beauty of this mighty
cataract and its splendor. He had heard of its
wonders, but had never dreamed it could be like
this.</p>

<p>But there was little time to dwell on its grandeur
and sublimity. The harsh voices of their guards
drove the prisoners on. To the besotted minds
of their captors the cataract was nothing, except
that it signified that they were once more at home
and now could revel in the torture of their victims.</p>

<p>The main village lay near the foot of the fall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and from this now came pouring out the women
and children and old men of the tribe.</p>

<p>There were shouts of delight as they saw the
number of prisoners that their warriors had
brought with them. They gathered about the
captives, taunting and jeering at them and striking
them with sticks until the guards intervened, not
out of pity, but in order that the captives might
be kept in good condition for the horrid festival
that Nascanora was planning.</p>

<p>The prisoners passed through the streets of the
village and their hearts sank, for they saw the
human heads, shriveled and blackened by the sun,
that were fastened on poles on the tops of the
wigwams. They had evidently been there a long
time. Now a new collection was in prospect.</p>

<p>In the center of the village was a rough stockade.
Into this the prisoners were corralled and
left under the supervision of guards, while the
others of the band dispersed to their homes.</p>

<p>The captives sank down under a pall of horror.
This, then, was the end of the trail. A day or
two more, while their captors were preparing for
the great festival of blood, and then torture and
death.</p>

<p>The only calm and collected person in the whole
enclosure was Bomba. Not that he was dwelling
in a fool’s paradise. He did not disguise from
himself the awfulness of the situation. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
faced it unflinchingly. His courage had never
been at a higher pitch. His mind had never
worked more clearly. He could die, and die
bravely, if need be. But he meant to live.</p>

<p>He was making things as comfortable as he
could for Casson and little Pirah when he heard
his name spoken. He looked up quickly and saw
before him Ruspak, the medicine man.</p>

<p>It was Ruspak that Bomba had once captured
in the jungle and compelled to accompany him to
the cabin where Casson lay at the point of death.
Against his will, Ruspak had been forced to minister
to the sick man, whom his native medicines
finally brought back from the grave. When this
had been done, Bomba had dismissed the medicine
man with gifts and they had parted with professions
of friendship.</p>

<p>But how insincere those professions had been
on the part of Ruspak and how deeply he had resented
the affront to his dignity as a medicine man
was evident now by the malignity in his eyes and
the gloating smile on his lips.</p>

<p>“So Bomba, the mighty Bomba, is a prisoner in
the hands of Nascanora!” he jeered. “He finds
now what happens to one who insults the messenger
of the gods.”</p>

<p>Bomba looked at him quietly, but made no
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Where now is the white man’s magic?” Ruspak
sneered, as he looked mockingly at Casson.
“Where is the puma that kept guard before the
door?”</p>

<p>Still Bomba kept quiet, and looked at his tormentor
with a contempt that stung Ruspak to the
quick.</p>

<p>“So Bomba has lost his tongue,” snapped the
medicine man. “But Nascanora will find that
tongue. He will pull it out with redhot pincers.
Then he will cool Bomba’s mouth with water.
You came to the Giant Cataract. You see plenty
water. Bomba shall have water. We will fill
his body with it till he bursts.”</p>

<p>Still Bomba disdained to answer.</p>

<p>“Bomba is strong,” mocked Ruspak. “Very
strong. That is good. He can stand torture for a
long time before he dies. His eyes can be plucked
out, and still he will live. He can be burned with
torches in a hundred places and still he will live.
His fingers can be cut off one by one, and still he
will live. Death will seem very sweet to Bomba.
He will pray for it, but it will be a long time before
it comes. Nascanora will see to that.”</p>

<p>But all his recital of the horrid tortures that
were preparing for Bomba failed to elicit a single
word from the contemptuous captive, and Ruspak
at last left him and went away, mumbling to himself
and licking his lips in anticipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Bomba turned to Casson and Hondura, who
were seated near by. He hoped that they had not
heard all that Ruspak had said. But the tears in
the faded eyes of Casson showed that he had
heard all too clearly and that his heart was wrung
with anguish.</p>

<p>“Do not mind him,” the lad soothed the old
man, as he patted him on the shoulder. “He
speaks big words, but they are like the wind in the
trees. If my hands had not been bound, it would
have been a bad thing for Ruspak.”</p>

<p>“He has a black heart and a tongue that is as
bitter as the aloe plant,” said Hondura.</p>

<p>Bomba glanced around to see that none of the
sentries were observing him.</p>

<p>“Hondura,” he said, “slip your hand under the
puma skin that covers my chest, reach up near my
neck and tell me what you find.”</p>

<p>Hondura did so, and drew back his hand quickly
as it touched something hard and sharp.</p>

<p>“It is your machete,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bomba in the same low tone. “I
hung it there in a noose when I heard the headhunters
were coming. After they had bound my
hands, they were in such a hurry to get away from
the witch, Sobrinini, that they did not search me.
They thought of it afterward, but when they
looked for it in my belt it was gone, and they
thought I had lost it or left it in Sobrinini’s house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
But it is here, and it will be a good friend to
Bomba.”</p>

<p>Hondura’s eyes lighted up as he grunted his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It may yet find the heart of Nascanora,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” assented Bomba. “But first the
hands of Bomba must be free. When it is dark,
Hondura will take the knife and cut the bonds of
Bomba, not all the way, or the guards may notice,
but so near through that Bomba can burst them
when he wills.”</p>

<p>“Hondura will do so,” promised the Araos
chief.</p>

<p>The tropic night soon fell and the darkness
was made more intense than usual by the absence
of moon or stars. A great storm was gathering.
Claps of thunder deafened their ears and vivid
lightning flashes shot across the sky.</p>

<p>Before long the windows of heaven were
opened, and the rain came down in a deluge. It
was a veritable cloudburst.</p>

<p>There was a shedlike structure in the stockade,
used for storage of fodder for the cattle, and into
this the prisoners huddled, finding some shelter
from the fury of the elements.</p>

<p>For hours the torrential rain persisted. All
that time Bomba’s brain was at work thinking out
plans of escape, rejecting one, seizing on another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and weighing the chances of all. The case was
desperate, but his spirit was indomitable.</p>

<p>Presently he noted a change in the sound of the
cataract. The rains had swelled it tremendously,
and its roar had increased. But it was not this
that the jungle lad especially noted. It was a
series of sharp reports, of splintering crashes, of
jars that shook the earth, that caused him to listen
in wonder.</p>

<p>Then he heard a loud screaming as of men and
women in panic, a rushing of many feet and hoarse
shouts that sent the guards scurrying from their
posts in terror.</p>

<p>“The rocks of the falls are breaking! The
cataract is coming down on the village! Run!
Run! Run!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>A MAD STAMPEDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> was on his feet instantly, his mind working
with precision and rapidity.</p>

<p>He sensed in a moment the full meaning of the
calamity and the advantages that he and the other
captives might reap from it.</p>

<p>The enormous bulk of water that had swelled
the volume of the cataract from the rain had
broken the rocks that formed its brink. These had
given way so that the course of the cataract had
changed, and part of the water that had previously
fallen into the gorge was now sweeping down on
the doomed village.</p>

<p>In accordance with his promise, Hondura had
severed the boy’s bonds so that only a single
strand was left. This he snapped like thread.</p>

<p>The guards had gone, forgetting all about the
prisoners in the wild instinct of self-preservation.
They had joined the rabble that were now rushing
from their huts and through the passageways between,
only intent for the moment on getting away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
from the waters that threatened to overwhelm
them.</p>

<p>Bomba called Hondura and Pipina to his side.</p>

<p>“The gods have been good to us,” he cried.
“We must go now and go quickly. They will not
think of us until their fright is over. Hondura,
get your people and lead them out. Pipina, take
care of Casson. I will take Pirah—carry her if
necessary—and go in front. Keep close to me.”</p>

<p>In a twinkling his orders were carried out. The
prisoners, stirred to new life by this unexpected
chance of escape after all hope had been lost, responded
to the call of their chief, hurried out of
the stockade and mingled with the frantic, fleeing
headhunters.</p>

<p>Not the slightest notice was taken of them by
their captors. The night was very dark, and in
their excitement it was impossible for the headhunters
to distinguish friend from foe. All
thought was lost save that of getting away from
the doom that threatened them.</p>

<p>Bomba’s marvelous sense of direction stood him
in good stead. Dark as it was, he knew exactly the
way he meant to go.</p>

<p>Luckily it was not the way in which the majority
of the panic-stricken people had chosen. They
were pressing toward the north. Bomba’s plan
was to go toward the south, retracing the path
they had followed that afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>This had a double advantage. With every step
he would be widening the distance between the
prisoners and their captors. If he could once win
clear of the crowd, he and his companions would
have a whole night’s start in case of pursuit.</p>

<p>Then, too, he felt sure that by this time the
people of Hondura’s tribe, with what auxiliaries
they could have mustered, had set out to rescue
their chief. At any time now they might be met
coming, and coming in such force that they would
have a good chance for victory, if it came to a
fight with the headhunters.</p>

<p>Bomba hurried on in the lead, protecting and
shielding little Pirah in every way he could.
Pipina and Casson were close behind, and the rest
of the prisoners, led by Hondura, followed at
their heels.</p>

<p>The party of captives had almost reached the
end of the straggling village when a huge figure
loomed up before them. He was hastening in a
direction opposite to them, but not at such a headlong
pace, as though he had a certain dignity to
maintain which forbade too much yielding to
fright.</p>

<p>Bomba could not see his face, but he knew that
there was but one such towering figure in the tribe.
It was Nascanora!</p>

<p>Bomba handed over Pirah to Hondura. Then
he felt for his knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>He still kept up his pace, hoping to pass the
chief without being noticed. But there was something
in his stride or form that aroused the chief’s
suspicions.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he commanded, barring the way and
stooping down to peer into the boy’s face.</p>

<p>Bomba had pulled out his knife from its hiding
place by the blade. He had no time to grasp the
hilt, but with all the power in his muscular arm
he swung the heavy weapon, and the iron haft
struck Nascanora right between the eyes. The
giant chief went down as though he had been hit
by an axe.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Bomba dragged him out of the
road and threw him into the bushes at the side.</p>

<p>“Better make sure with the point of the knife,”
suggested Hondura.</p>

<p>“No,” said Bomba, “I will not kill a man who
cannot fight. He will not wake till morning, and
then we shall be far from here.”</p>

<p>His hopes were higher now as he pressed on.
His one fear had been that Nascanora might rally
his people and pursue his former prisoners. That
fear now had vanished. Without their chief the
headhunters would be confused and bewildered,
and, not knowing what to do, would probably do
nothing.</p>

<p>But now another enemy threatened. The
waters of the cataract that had already wiped out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
most of the village were expanding into the open
country. Already it was lapping at the fugitives’
heels, as though determined to draw them back
and overwhelm them. It retarded their progress.
Their feet stuck in the clammy ooze. The water
kept rising higher and higher. It reached their
ankles. It reached their knees. It seemed as
though it were destined to conquer.</p>

<p>Then, just when it seemed that hope must be
abandoned, an inspiriting cry came from Bomba.</p>

<p>“The road is leading upward!” he shouted.
“We are coming to a hill! The waters shall not
have us!”</p>

<p>There was a jubilant chorus of shouts as the
party struck the incline, and in a few minutes they
were on ground above the swirling waters of the
mighty river. The Giant Cataract had reached
out for them, but they had eluded its grasp!</p>

<p>It was an exhausted but happy throng of
refugees that sank down upon the slope as soon
as they had reached a safe distance.</p>

<p>Their situation had changed as though by the
waving of a magician’s wand. Two hours before
they had been helpless victims in the hands of the
headhunters, doomed to torture and to death.
Now their enemies were scattered, demoralized,
fleeing for their lives from an enemy as pitiless
as themselves.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased now, and the traveling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
promised to be easier. Bomba gave them a little
time to rest, and then the journey was resumed.</p>

<p>The lake that now extended between them and
their enemies was another element in their favor.
It would be some time before the waters would
subside so as to make pursuit possible.</p>

<p>All through the night the little party pressed
on, and not until the first glimmer of dawn appeared
in the eastern sky did they stop to make
camp and obtain a much needed rest on the banks
of the River of Death.</p>

<p>While the Indians scurried around in the forest
to find jaboty eggs, nuts, and fruit for the morning
meal, Bomba climbed a great tree on the bank
of the river to look back on the trail they had
traversed.</p>

<p>From the top he could see for many miles. His
keen eyes scanned the horizon, but could detect no
traces of pursuers.</p>

<p>With his heart temporarily at rest, he was about
to descend when he became conscious of a swaying,
rocking motion of the tree. At the same moment
a shout came from below:</p>

<p>“The tree is falling! Come down! Quick!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>IN THE SWIRL OF THE RAPIDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> warning to Bomba came too late.</p>

<p>The tree had been undermined by the current,
swelled by the recent rain. It had probably been
tottering to its fall when Bomba climbed it, and
his weight and his movements among the
branches determined its fate.</p>

<p>Bomba was too high to jump. From such a
distance he would surely have broken a limb and
possibly his neck. He could only cling tightly
to the bough on which he found himself and trust
to chance.</p>

<p>Slowly the tree toppled, and then, with a tremendous
splash, fell into the river. Its momentum
carried it for a moment beneath the surface.
Then it came up again with Bomba, drenched and
sputtering, still holding tightly to the bough.</p>

<p>Fortunately he had been on the landward side
of the tree, so that he was on the upper side as
the tree swirled in the current.</p>

<p>Now, as his eyes cleared, he found that he was
not alone. Ashati and Neram had been standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
at the foot of the tree, and as its great roots tore
loose from the ground they caught the two ex-slaves
and flung them with the force of a catapult
far out into the stream.</p>

<p>They had made for the tree as the nearest
haven of safety, and now climbed up into the
branches and drew as near as they could to
Bomba.</p>

<p>The lad’s first impulse, when he found himself
afloat, was to plunge into the river and swim for
the bank, two hundred feet away. But even as
the thought came into his mind he caught sight of
the scaly body and horrid head of an alligator
between him and the shore. The brute would
have had him before he had gone twenty feet.</p>

<p>By this time the tree had been caught in the
rapids, those terrible rapids of the River of Death
whose power Bomba had already tested.</p>

<p>Had it been merely the trunk of a tree on
which they found themselves, they would have
been tossed off in a moment. But the great
spreading branches kept it from turning over.
Even at that, it was tossed about like a chip, and
great waves broke over it, threatening at any
moment to dislodge Bomba and his two companions,
who had to hold on with all their might to
prevent being swept away.</p>

<p>The horror of their position was intensified by
the presence of a swarm of alligators, whose eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
had detected them and looked upon them as certain
prey. The monsters swam about the tree on every
side, at times dashing up from underneath with
wide open jaws, in the hope of reaching them and
pulling them down.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram thought that their last hour
had come, and Bomba was inclined to agree with
them. The tree might stay there, buffeted back
and forth, for days. They could not guide it.
They dared not leave it.</p>

<p>From the contemplation of his own plight, his
thoughts turned to those on shore. He was thankful
that they were safe for the moment. Hondura
was there to lead them, and the wily chief knew all
the lore and craft of the jungle. With the start he
had over his enemies and the probability that he
would soon fall in with his own warriors coming to
his rescue, Hondura would probably win through.</p>

<p>And Bomba knew that the old chief and his
people would take good care of Casson. Good
old Casson! Would he ever see the old man
again, the lad wondered.</p>

<p>But a different and more welcome turn was given
to his thoughts when Bomba discovered that the
fierce tossing had ceased. The tree had been
thrown from the rapids into smoother water, and
was now drifting in the grip of a strong current
in the same direction that Bomba’s canoe had
taken two days before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>In a little while the point of land resembling
a finger had been reached and passed, at so little
distance that it would have been easy to swim to it,
had it not been for the monster caymen that still
kept pace with them.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram had recovered their spirits,
now that they had escaped the grip of the rapids.</p>

<p>“The Spirit of the Jungle is good!” exclaimed
Ashati.</p>

<p>“It will not be long before we touch land somewhere,”
prophesied Neram, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bomba, as his eyes caught sight of
Sobrinini’s domain looming up before them, “and
the land will be Snake Island.”</p>

<p>At this name of ominous import a shudder ran
through Bomba’s companions.</p>

<p>“The island of the witch woman!” exclaimed
Ashati, making cabalistic signs to ward off evil.</p>

<p>“The woman with the evil eye which brings
death to everyone on whom it falls!” said Neram
with a shiver.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Bomba. “You talk like foolish
men. Is Bomba dead? Yet Sobrinini’s look fell
upon Bomba. She is a wise woman. Did she not
say that I would come back to Snake Island? And
is Bomba not going back? I do not like her
snakes. But she has done no evil to Bomba, and
she will do no hurt to Bomba’s friends. And
Ashati and Neram are my friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The boy’s words brought some reassurance to
his companions, but not enough to banish their
fears wholly, and it was with great trepidation
that they viewed the dreaded island as the tree
drew ever nearer.</p>

<p>As for Bomba himself, he was almost glad at
the accident which had at the time seemed so
disastrous. He would not of his own accord have
taken the time just now to visit Sobrinini again,
eager as he was to renew his questioning. She had
been on the very point of telling him what he
wanted to know when Nascanora and his braves
had broken in upon them. Perhaps this time he
would be more fortunate.</p>

<p>He was immersed in these thoughts when to
their ears came a wailing cry, so weird, so uncanny,
so long drawn out, that it chilled their blood.</p>

<p>It came from the direction of the island, but,
strain their eyes as they might, they could detect
no human figure from whom the cry might have
issued.</p>

<p>The sound was the signal for another outbreak
of fear on the part of the ex-slaves. They were
brave enough when facing human or animal foes,
as they had shown in their combat with the
jaguars, but when brought in contact with what
they regarded as supernatural, their hearts melted
within them.</p>

<p>They whimpered and cowered and glanced at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the water, as though they were almost willing to
take their chances with the alligators rather than
approach the island they deemed accursed.</p>

<p>But they had drawn nearer now and they could
detect an agitated, tumultuous group of figures on
the shore.</p>

<p>The wailing cry came again, so near this time
that Ashati and Neram nearly lost their grip on
the boughs.</p>

<p>Then from out the fringe of trees that lined the
shore shot a small canoe, paddled with frantic
energy by a withered old woman, her straggling
locks streaming behind her head, her face convulsed
with fear.</p>

<p>“Sobrinini!” cried Bomba.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE RESCUE OF SOBRININI</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> Bomba, to think was to act.</p>

<p>In a moment he had made his way out on the
bough to a point where the foliage thinned out and
there was a chance of his being seen.</p>

<p>“Sobrinini! Sobrinini!” he shouted at the top
of his voice.</p>

<p>At the call, the old crone ceased paddling for a
moment and turned her haggard face in the direction
of the tree.</p>

<p>“Who calls?” she cried shrilly. “Who is it that
calls Sobrinini?”</p>

<p>“It is Bomba!” shouted the lad, at the same
time shaking the bough of the tree violently to
attract her attention.</p>

<p>She caught the movement of the foliage, and,
peering closely, saw the outline of Bomba’s face
and form.</p>

<p>“Bartow!” she cried. “Or is it Bartow’s ghost?
You have come to see Sobrinini die.”</p>

<p>“No!” replied Bomba. “I have come to help
Sobrinini live. Come quickly!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>This last admonition was prompted by the sight
of another boat containing several natives of the
island putting out from the shore. He sensed at
once that their errand was hostile.</p>

<p>Sobrinini saw them too, and with a few strokes
of her paddle brought the canoe directly beneath
the jungle boy.</p>

<p>Bomba dropped lightly into the canoe, and then
held it steady until Ashati and Neram had time to
follow his example.</p>

<p>The other boat was coming on rapidly now, and
time was pressing. Bomba took the paddle from
Sobrinini’s hands and pressed her gently to the
bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>But before he dipped the paddle into the water
he drew his knife and shook it menacingly at the
approaching natives.</p>

<p>“Go back or you will die!” he shouted. “This
is the knife that frightened Nascanora. It made
his heart like that of a woman. Who are you to
stand before it when even the chief of the headhunters
was afraid?”</p>

<p>It was a wholesome reminder, and it had an
immediate effect. They recognized Bomba now as
the jungle boy whose challenge Nascanora had
been afraid to accept. That scene had made an
indelible impression upon their minds. They
stopped paddling, and excited jabbering ensued.</p>

<p>Bomba faced them for a full minute. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
with a disdainful gesture he replaced the knife in
his belt, as though they were foes too insignificant
to bother with any further, took up the paddle,
and without once looking behind him made for the
opposite shore.</p>

<p>His evident fearlessness and contempt decided
the issue. The pursuing party, after a little irresolution,
gave up the chase and turned the prow
of their boat in the direction of Snake Island.</p>

<p>Sobrinini had said nothing coherent since her
rescue, but sat crouched on the bottom of the boat
mumbling to herself, her long, disheveled hair
shielding her face. Bomba regarded her curiously
from time to time, half expecting to see one or
more snakes make their appearance. But it soon
became apparent that all her horrid “pets” had
been left behind in her hurried flight.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram kept as far away from her
as they could, crowding against each other to
avoid contact with the “witch” whose name spread
terror through all that region.</p>

<p>Why had she fled from the island where she had
so long held sway? Why had her formerly submissive
slaves turned against her? Bomba longed
to question her, but had to defer that to another
time. He wished that she had brought with her
that picture, the picture of that sweet, beautiful
woman, whose eyes had looked so fondly into his.</p>

<p>After a long siege of paddling, the boat touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the farther shore. Bomba jumped out and pulled
the canoe far up on the shelving bank. Then he
helped Sobrinini out, while Ashati and Neram
leaped ashore quickly, glad to be freed from their
enforced proximity to the witch.</p>

<p>At Bomba’s command, the men scattered to
gather a little food from the forest, and soon
returned with nuts and berries that partially satisfied
their hunger.</p>

<p>Bidding them stay where they were, Bomba
penetrated some distance into the jungle to see
if he could pick up the trail of Hondura and his
party.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before he began to sniff.
He smelled smoke. His eyes followed the indications
of his nostrils, and he finally caught sight of
a shred of smoke rising above trees not far distant.</p>

<p>He was about to drop on his hands and knees
and creep through the brush to reconnoiter, when
he heard a sound that made his heart leap with
delight.</p>

<p>It came to him faintly, and yet was unmistakable.
Somebody was playing a harmonica!</p>

<p>Reassured now, but still not abandoning his
habitual caution, he moved forward until from the
shelter of a bush he could see encamped in a clearing,
while they prepared their midday meal, a
large party of natives, evidently on the warpath,
as they were armed to the teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>He knew them at once. They were the Araos
coming to the rescue of their chief. There was
Lodo, evidently in command, a little apart from
the rest. And there was Grico, squatting on his
haunches and bringing weird sounds from Bomba’s
harmonica for the delectation of his mates.</p>

<p>Bomba stepped from the shelter of the bush, his
hands upraised with palms outward in sign of
friendship.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of ejaculations, a hurried
grasping of weapons, and then shouts of pleasure
as they recognized the newcomer.</p>

<p>They crowded about him with every manifestation
of delight, overwhelming him with questions.
And cries of joy went up as Bomba, in as few
words as possible, told them what had happened
and that Hondura with the ex-captives must be
close at hand and coming to meet them.</p>

<p>Instantly their meal was forgotten as they
gathered up their weapons and supplies and prepared
to go forward to greet their chief, their
women, and their children.</p>

<p>Grico, the man with the one eye and the split
nose, had listened to Bomba’s story with such
absorbed interest that he still held the harmonica
loosely in his hand. Bomba reached out coolly
and took it from him.</p>

<p>Grico looked astonished and sheepish. And he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
was still more abashed when Bomba, noting a
protuberance in Grico’s pouch, reached in and
drew out the precious revolver.</p>

<p>“It was good of Grico to keep these for Bomba
till he should come back again,” said the boy in
the friendliest of tones, as he stowed away the
treasures in his pouch.</p>

<p>His look was so kindly, so innocent, that Grico
did not know what to do or say. Ordinarily this
would have meant a fight. But Grico knew that
Bomba was a bad opponent to pick for a fight,
and, besides, at this moment, the boy was high in
the favor of the tribe.</p>

<p>And Bomba’s eyes were very compelling, despite
their friendliness. Grico had never heard of an
iron hand in a velvet glove, but he felt that something
of that kind was very close by.</p>

<p>So he swallowed hard for a moment, and then
took advantage of the opening that Bomba had
given him.</p>

<p>“Y—yes,” he stammered. “Grico found them
in the jungle and kept them for Bomba.”</p>

<p>“Grico did well, and Bomba will not forget,”
said the lad gravely.</p>

<p>It was arranged hastily that Bomba should go
back and get his companions and then join the war
party as they went forward to meet their chief.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram greeted Bomba’s news with
cries of delight. Sobrinini showed no emotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
whatever. It was doubtful whether she understood.
She was sunk in a state of apathy, the
natural reaction from her exciting experiences.</p>

<p>It was difficult to get her to her feet at all, but
the need was urgent and Bomba put his strong arm
under hers, and with Ashati and Neram made as
good time as possible in the direction of the line of
march.</p>

<p>Luckily, their journey was not prolonged, for
before an hour had passed a joyous hubbub not
far ahead told them that the two parties had
joined forces. Hondura and the ex-prisoners were
once more with their own people.</p>

<p>Bomba was welcomed with wild acclaim when
he came into view. Casson and Pipina especially
greeted him with tears and embraces that testified
how deeply they were moved.</p>

<p>There was a great feast to celebrate the reunion,
followed by a long powwow between Hondura,
Grico and Lodo. Bomba was invited to
join the conference, but declined, as he felt this
was a matter that concerned them chiefly and he
did not want to take any responsibility for the
future movements of the tribe.</p>

<p>The result of the powwow was that the natives
formed themselves into two bands. One, consisting
of picked warriors under the leadership of
Lodo, with Grico as his lieutenant, proceeded
toward the Giant Cataract to give battle to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
headhunters and remove forever, if possible, that
menace to the peaceful tribes of the region.</p>

<p>Others, under the guidance of the aged chief,
Hondura, convoyed the rescued women and children
in the direction of their maloca, which they
planned to rebuild.</p>

<p>The grateful Hondura detailed eight of his
men to make two litters on which they bore Casson
and Sobrinini, who had reached the limit of
their strength, to the cabin of Pipina.</p>

<p>When their paths at last diverged, Hondura
and Bomba clasped each other by the shoulders
and vowed eternal friendship. Pirah wept bitterly
at the separation, and could only be comforted by
Bomba’s promise to come to see her before long.</p>

<p>Bomba had cherished a vague hope that something
dramatic would take place when Casson
and Sobrinini were brought face to face. He
hoped the meeting would unlock the floodgates of
memories which they shared in common.</p>

<p>But to his bitter disappointment nothing of the
kind occurred. Age had changed each so utterly
that neither recognized the other. They looked
at each other indifferently, and then their eyes
turned away.</p>

<p>He had not named either one to the other as
yet, and both were so apathetic that they showed
no curiosity. But though disheartened, Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
did not wholly despair. When they should get to
the cabin of Pipina he would try again.</p>

<p>Ashati and Neram had begged to be allowed to
go along with Bomba, and he had willingly agreed.
The faithful fellows were devoted to him heart
and soul, and they might be of great service to
him whenever he should be compelled to absent
himself from the cabin.</p>

<p>Shred by shred, in monosyllables and muttered
exclamations, Bomba gathered, as he walked beside
Sobrinini’s litter, the reason for her flight
from the island. He had already guessed it pretty
accurately.</p>

<p>Her harsh rule had for a long time galled the
natives, who sought an excuse for rebellion. That
excuse had been found in the visit of Nascanora.
They had expected that she would annihilate him
on the spot. Was she not a witch? But when, on
the contrary, Nascanora had triumphed and taken
her guest from under her protection, their belief
in her supernatural powers failed, their long-smothered
resentment broke forth, and she had
been compelled to flee for her life.</p>

<p>The little party reached the cabin of Pipina
without any untoward happening, the braves departed
for their maloca, and the little household,
now increased by three, was reëstablished.</p>

<p>Bomba waited till several days had elapsed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
his aged charges had become rested and strengthened
after their exhausting experiences before he
broached the subject that was nearest his heart.</p>

<p>Then, one evening after supper, he turned to
them as they were sitting dreamily in the large
room of the little cabin.</p>

<p>“Casson!” he said. “Sobrinini! Look upon
each other and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>They started at his sharp command, and gazed
bewilderedly at him, then at each other.</p>

<p>At first there was no recognition, but as they
gazed fixedly a dawning wonderment came into
their eyes.</p>

<p>Casson was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Sobrinini!” he cried. “No, that is not Sobrinini.
Sobrinini was beautiful. Sobrinini could
sing. And yet—and yet——”</p>

<p>“Casson!” exclaimed Sobrinini in her turn. “It
cannot be Casson. He was young and strong, and
his hair was like that of the raven. But I am Sobrinini.
I can sing. Listen!”</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and sang in her cracked
voice the song that Bomba had heard in the language
he did not understand. As she sang, Casson
began to beat his withered palms together in applause,
and finally got to his feet and started to
dance about the room.</p>

<p>It was weird and uncanny, and Bomba looked
on, fascinated yet horrified, until the song ended,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the dance stopped, and the aged participants sank
trembling in their chairs.</p>

<p>“You do know each other!” cried Bomba.
“And you know about my father and my mother.
Tell me, oh, tell me who they were, where they
are! Tell me!”</p>

<p>They looked at him, trying to gather their poor
scattered wits. Casson rubbed his forehead with
his hand.</p>

<p>“Ask Jojasta,” he muttered. “I cannot remember.
The door is closed. But Jojasta knows.
Ask him.”</p>

<p>“But Jojasta is dead!” exclaimed Bomba.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Casson. “You told me he
was dead. Then ask Sobrinini. Nini will know.”</p>

<p>In desperation, Bomba turned to the woman.</p>

<p>“You tell me,” he begged. “You were going
to tell me when Nascanora came. Tell me now!”</p>

<p>“I forget—I forget,” murmured Sobrinini. “I
cannot tell you, Bartow.”</p>

<p>“I am not Bartow,” said Bomba.</p>

<p>“Then you are his ghost,” muttered the crone.</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Bomba. “Look at me. Try
to remember.”</p>

<p>She stared at him long and hard.</p>

<p>“If you are not Bartow nor Bartow’s ghost, you
are his son,” she declared. “Andrew Bartow and
Laura—yes, her name was Laura—had a son
who was named Bonny. She used to sing to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
like this—” and again she crooned the tender
cradle song that had stirred Bomba so strangely.</p>

<p>She relapsed into meditation, still humming that
haunting song.</p>

<p>“Yes,” prompted Bomba eagerly. “Where are
Bartow and Laura now? And Bonny——”</p>

<p>“Bonny!” she repeated. “Oh, yes, Bonny was
stolen. He was stolen from home by—by—Japazy!
That was his name—a half-breed. Japazy
hated Bartow and hated Casson, too. I do
not know why he hated them. And then—and
then—oh, I cannot remember! But ask Japazy—he
will know. Look for Japazy on Jaguar Island
above the cataract.”</p>

<p>Her voice died away in disjointed mutterings,
and from neither her nor Casson could he get anything
clearer that evening nor in the days that
followed.</p>

<p>The boy was desperate. It seemed that the
half-demented man and woman could get no
further. Bomba had got merely a clue.</p>

<p>But that in itself was something. How Bomba
followed it up and what exciting perils and adventures
he met in fulfilling his task will be told in
the next volume of this series, entitled: “Bomba
the Jungle Boy on Jaguar Island; or, Adrift on
the River of Mystery.”</p>

<p>From the pain and disappointment in his heart
Bomba sought relief with his wild friends of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
forest. They could always sympathize with his
mood and in some degree understand it. To them
he talked, and they chattered in reply. And his
sore heart was eased in their companionship.</p>

<p>One day, when he had been playing his harmonica
and Doto, the monkey, and Kiki and Woowoo,
the parrots, and others of their mates were
gathered around him, there was a crashing in the
bushes, and faithful Polulu, the giant puma,
bounded into the clearing.</p>

<p>The others scattered like magic as the formidable
beast came up to Bomba, purring and rubbing
his head against him.</p>

<p>“Good old Polulu!” exclaimed Bomba, as he
caressed the great head affectionately. “He is
one of Bomba’s best friends. Bomba is glad to see
him. But Bomba cannot stay with Polulu long.
He is going on a long journey. For Bomba’s place
is not here. He is not a native of the jungle. He
has a soul. He is white. Yes, Bomba is white.
And Bomba’s soul cannot be at rest until he dwells
among the white people.”</p>
